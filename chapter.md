  This chapter contrasts comparative histories of architecture, prevalent
  from the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries, to the critical method of
  history that is claimed by recent works. Comparative history arose out
  of the Idealist philosophy of history and combined its deterministic
  narrative with a disciplinary bounding of architecture that followed
  modern assumptions about decision-making in design. Critical history,
  on the other hand, is a materialistic approach that does not
  acknowledge disciplinary boundaries. Whereas critical history may lay
  claim, nowadays, to being the only proper form of historiography,
  comparative histories were more closely linked to the methods and
  categorizations of the discipline of architecture. Some recent
  architectural history textbooks, committed as they were to the
  critical method, nevertheless allowed Idealistic determinism to creep
  into their narrative structure. I argue this creep is not a
  shortcoming of these individual works, but a consequence of the
  contradictions between the non-disciplinary project of critical
  history and its uncertain place in the professional architectural
  education. I further develop on this contradiction by comparing it
  to the broader problem of how the critical history of architecture
  relates to supporting disciplines such as building archaeology, the
  archaeology of architecture, or the scholarship of vernacular
  environments. These fields interact with history by providing source
  material and preliminary interpretations, yet they have an uneasy
  relationship to critical history due to their partial reliance on
  concepts and categories developed in the professional practice of
  architecture. The inability of critical architectural history to come
  to terms with the historical legitimacy of its supporting disciplines
  is akin to its inability to acknowledge the persistence of Idealistic
  assumptions in textbooks that cater to the professional education
  market.

# Introduction #

This chapter contrasts two ways of looking at the
architecture of the past that have been prevalent in research and
teaching within professional architecture
schools: "comparative history" and "critical
history". Many textbooks from the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries adopted a
*comparative method*, notably Banister Fletcher's eponymous book
[@fletcher:1896history]. However, criticism has become so central to our
understanding of the "task" of history as outlined by Manfredo
@tafuri:1968teorie that comparative studies are now scarcely
acknowledged as a form *history*. Despite this, the comparative form has a
stronger claim to being *architecture*. This contrast has spilled over
from the education of professional architects to raise issues in the
writing and practice of supporting disciplines of architectural history.

Much of the publishing market for architectural history textbooks is
concentrated in North America and Western Europe. Therefore, we will
focus on a few major publications from these regions as well as some
noteworthy theoretical contributions from South America. This is in part
because history as a
humanistic pursuit and literary craft has been marginalized in professional
architectural education in much of continental Europe. The context of
this discussion is thus mainly focused on how global architectural history
appears from the perspective of the Americas, North to South, and to a
lesser extent the Iberian peninsula and Belgium.

These regions, where architectural education has long been integrated
into universities, have nurtured the ideal of a humanistic and generalist
education for architects. Moreover, unlike much of
continental Europe and the British isles where the scholar--architect is
a relatively new development, architectural historians in the Americas
and the Iberian peninsula often, if not mostly, come out of professional
training. Given their exposure to French, British, and North American
textbooks, this
geographic scope is logically self-contained.

The problem of history in professional architectural education thus lies
in the interplay between two pairs of concepts in tension:
first, that between the comparative method as
part of an Idealist view of scholarship and the critical approach as a
development of historical materialism; second, the tension between the
discipline of architecture bearing upon professional education and the
non-disciplinary field of history as understood within the frame of the
humanistic universities.

This brings up a long-standing
paradox concerning the place of architectural history in professional
education and practice. This paradox has played out in a few
21^st^-century textbooks attempting to distance themselves from the
comparative method. Critical history operates most effectively as an
interpretive paradigm when applied to architectural cultures critically
aware of their
own historicity. As such, architectural history has drifted
towards more recent subject matter, thus re-entering the territory of
disciplinary theory that critical historians initially sought to avoid.
Addressing this disciplinary tension nowadays involves heuristic
approaches that acknowledge the role of disciplinary methods in
studying past architecture and establish particular relations to
historical criticism.

A number of other historiographic currents have been left out of this
discussion, notably the diverse forms of Idealist criticism and
formalism widespread from the first half of the 20^th^
century up to the 1960s. These currents were already examined by
scholars such as Michael @podro:1982critical, Alan
@colquhoun:1981historicism, Alina @payne:1994rudolf, David Watkin
[-@watkin:1977morality; -@watkin:1980rise], and Giorgio
@pigafetta:1993architettura. Neither does this chapter delve into
textbooks focused on Western architecture published
in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, such as Watkin's
[@watkin:2005history], Marvin Trachtenberg and Isabelle Hyman's
[@trachtenberg:1986architecture], or José Ramón Alonso Pereira's
[@alonso:1995introduccion]. Finally, the German tradition of
architectural history textbooks is too deeply tied to encyclopaedic
professional manuals to be profitably confronted with the Atlantic
tradition of standalone textbooks.

Both the comparative and the critical methods in architectural history
originated in Europe at the intersection of Idealist criticism and the
modern discipline of architecture. Idealism is now commonly associated
with the Prussian thinkers Immanuel Kant's *Critiques* and G.W.F.
Hegel's philosophy of history, yet it really was a web of intellectual
developments in the 18^th^ century. An Idealist philosophy of art
history was shaped more or less independently from classical philology
and antiquarianism [@momigliano:1990classical], through the Italian
philosopher Giambattista Vico [@ciardo:1947quattro]. A third, better
known strand, ran from a circle of Catholic German-speaking artists and
antiquarians who may have influenced the Austrian connoisseur Johann
Joachim Winckelmann [@kaufmann:2001antiquarianism62] in formulating his
system of identity between historical periodization, culture, and style
(@fig:winckelmann) several decades before Hegel.

![Title page from the first edition (posthumous) of Winckelmann's *History of Art in Antiquity*, 1764](media/figure-1.tif){#fig:winckelmann}

It was in fact the concurrent development of
art and architectural history, on the one hand, and of the modern
professional education in architecture, on the other, that set the
conditions for the hegemony of Idealist criticism as an interpretive
paradigm in the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries. Unlike earlier artists'
biographies in the Vasarian tradition, Winckelmann's system put forward
a new understanding of history as a sequence of conceptual boxes. In
each of these boxes, a style could be logically explained by the context
in which it arose. This entailed an awareness that there was, in the
famous words of the neo-Kantian art historian [@hart:1982reinterpreting]
Heinrich @woelfflin:1950principles [1], "no such thing as objective
vision" across different ages and styles. Therefore, one of the major
tasks of Idealist art and especially architectural history was,
according to @podro:1982critical [xv], bringing an historical artwork to
bear upon "our conception of art" and thus reshaping the latter through
comparison with the past.[^4]

[^4]: Michael Podro, writing in the 1970s, called this form of art
    historical scholarship "critical", but his use of the word is
    unrelated to what has come to be understood as "critical history"
    since the 1990s.

This paradigm served well the articulation of education and professional
practice that was, according to @egbert:1980beauxarts and
@epron:1997comprendre, at the core of the Beaux-Arts schools system.
Then, as the absorption of architecture schools by the university system
in Italy and the Americas was completed by the mid 20^th^ century,
specialist architectural historians began to pry scholarship apart from
operative theory. To do so, they emphasized an implication of the
Idealist philosophy of history as reinterpreted by Walter Benjamin and
other Marxist thinkers. This implication was that the "boxes" of the
past could never be explained in their entirety by the modern scholar,
and only fragments could be laboriously and provisionally reconstructed
[@tafuri:1980sfera, 22].
These specialist historians held that "dissecting" the "crises" of
historical structures was thus more relevant to scholarship than studying
style as a unified system [@palazzo:2021death]. Hence, this form of
historiography claimed the sobriquet "critical".


# Comparative history as architecture #

Comparative textbooks such as James Fergusson's early *Illustrated
Handbook of Architecture*, Étienne Barberot's *Histoire des styles*,
Auguste Choisy's *Histoire de l'architecture*, or Fletchers' *History of
Architecture on the Comparative Method* portrayed architectural
history as a collection of culture--epochs through time and space, each
signaled by a characteristic style [@barberot:1891histoire, v. 1, p. v]. These
styles did not arise at random, but resulted almost deterministically
from the interplay between the historical unfolding of the human mind
and the constraints of geography, climate, materials, and inherited
technical knowledge (@fig:treearch).

![The tree of architecture, from Banister Fletcher's *A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method*, 5^th^ ed. (1905)](media/figure-2.tif){#fig:treearch}

It is the determinism implicit in the timeline of styles that makes
these works instances of a philosophy of history. What makes them
Idealist is the assumption that such determinism was rooted outside the
practice of architecture itself. These roots hinge on the moral
character of a nation, for example the clarity of the Ancient Greeks
according to @winckelmann:1764geschichte or the spiritual nature of
Hindu architecture according to @fergusson:1855illustrated [v. 1].
Alternative, historians could invoke a more abstract "will to form"
[@riegl:1893stilfragen] or "feeling for form" [@woelfflin:1949italien]
peculiar to each time period and region. Another tradition,
much more influential in architectural histories, saw the roots of style
in material and social conditions rather than mental states.
It was with technological rationalists such
as Viollet-Le-Duc that the social and material determinism was strongest
[@collins:1988changing].

The deterministic development of style was not the only aspect of an
Idealist philosophy of history that these 19^th^-century textbooks
borrowed. They also consolidated a practice that would become a hallmark
of architectural history textbooks to the present day: using a few,
often monumental examples to stand in for the general character of a
culture--epoch [@ghirardo:2008review67]. Idealist systems of art
history are infamous for having little concern for the particulars of
individual facts. This is not, however, an entirely fair assessment.

Choisy, for example, drew his analyses from several lesser-known
buildings from the Ancient and Medieval Mediterranean. He had studied
some of these in detail in his earlier work on Roman and Byzantine
architecture [@choisy:1873romains; @choisy:1883byzantins]. In his
broader *Histoire de l'architecture*, he presented
only partial aspects of each building insofar as they served to
illustrate the general characteristics and trends of each style. In a
sense, Choisy's canon is not made of great works, but of general
principles. He omitted such masterworks as Chartres cathedral from his
timeline in order to fit more obscure buildings like Saint-Andoche at
Saulieu, which better illustrated his argument on the development of
structural form (@fig:saulieu). Likewise,
the Renaissance, a period when individual character slowly
gains ground over cultural trends, is only superficially discussed at
the end of the second volume of his textbook.

![Basilica of Saint-Andoche, Saulieu, completed 1119. Plan-axonometric by Auguste Choisy, *Histoire de l'architecture* v. 2, p. 232](media/figure-3.tif){#fig:saulieu}

Comparative histories of architecture did not, of course, invent
the Western canon and its oversimplifications. However, James Fergusson,
for one, likely played a role in providing a rationale for this canon.
Long before Fletcher's distinction between "historical" and
"non-historical" styles [@baydar:1998postcolonial, 11], Fergusson
divided the history of architecture in two parts: "Pagan" styles first,
then "Christian" buildings together with their precedents in classical
societies [@fergusson:1855illustrated1, vii]. Thus, he implied that only
the strand leading through classical Antiquity to the Gothic style had a
truly historical development.

Comparative historians painted architecture in broad strokes where the
individual building was only proof of a general concept. At the same
time, however, they gave great weight to the architects'
decision-making in response to these external constraints. This apparent
contradiction dissolves when we look at the context in which they wrote.
On the one hand, like art history, architectural scholarship
in 19^th^-century Europe sought to make sense of a growing
body of works unveiled by archaeology and colonialism. Unlike art
history, on the other hand, the history of architecture could not
retreat into a narrative of formal autonomy. At the same time as
European architects were experimenting with the new genre of history
writing [@watkin:1980rise], they had to grapple with a growing
instability in the very nature of the profession
[@epron:1997comprendre].

Comparative studies were thus tasked both with justifying aesthetic
judgments---that is, the choice among myriad Western and non-Western
styles---and with framing the discipline of architecture as a whole.
Surveys of historic buildings were devices to evidence the professional
expertise of architects through the ages. At the same time, the
Beaux-Arts architect's knowledge and use of historic precedents
justified his decision-making in design [@egbert:1980beauxarts].
By means of historical classifications, wrote Baydar
Gülsum, "the boundary between the inner and outer worlds of architecture
[was] carefully maintained for the purposes of disciplinary regulation and
control." [-@baydar:1998postcolonial, 8]

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

The expertise of architects extended beyond the choice of visual
precedents. With industrial and managerial development came increasingly
specific functional requirements [@tzonis:1972non-oppressive]. These
were at the core of what differentiated the Beaux-Arts architect from
the Polytechnic engineer [@epron:1997comprendre]. Banister Fletcher the
elder himself, prior to writing his textbook, had made a career in the
design of utilitarian buildings. Beyond the program itself, a broad
range of sociocultural expectations and
material, technical, or economic constraints had to be explicitly taken
into account in the design of modern plans.

*Explicitly* is key here, since these factors had always been present in
some way or another in every culture. The "crisis" of modern
European architecture, however, was that the variables of design
were no longer taken care of by a system of traditional, impersonal
wisdom. Instead, @caniggia:1987progetto [24] argued, each new, unique
project had to expressly articulate these variables moving forward. In
Fergusson's words, architects now felt the need to emulate other
"branches of artistic or scientific research" and to engage in
"philosophical inquiry" within their discipline
[-@fergusson:1855illustrated, v. 1, p. v].
In this practical sense, the past served not only as a moral teacher in
matters of style, but also as a trove of inspirational examples. Past
architects had balanced a variety of social and material requirements,
responding to cultural and geographic contexts, while producing
authentic styles of their time.

Now the crucial point of comparative histories of architecture is this:
their focus on graphic articulation was not due to their authors'
oversight of the social or material conditions in the production of
architecture---they made explicit points about these conditions. Rather,
it was because formal problem-solving
translated best across time and space, through very different cultures
and conditions, making it exemplary for modern architecture students.

Consider, for example, the following statements drawn from a few
comparative textbooks (emphasis added):

James Fergusson (@fig:fergusson)

: > Another refinement [in Greek columns] was making all the columns
  > slope slightly inwards, *so as to give an idea of strength and
  > support to the whole.* [@fergusson:1855illustrated1, 269]

![Greek Doric columns, from James Fergusson's *The Illustrated Handbook of Architecture*, 1:268 (1855)](media/figure-4.tif){#fig:fergusson}

Banister Fletcher (@fig:fletcher)

: > The main entrance [of the English Gothic church] was frequently by a
  > south-western porch, *acting as a screen against the cold winds*...
  > [@fletcher:1905history, 299]

![Comparative plans of English cathedrals, from Banister Fletcher's *A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method*, 5^th^ ed., 300--1 (1905)](media/figure-5.tif){#fig:fletcher}

Auguste Choisy (@fig:choisy)

: > Most romanesque barrel vaults have their intrados broken up at
  > regular intervals by ribs ... *these ribs were strengthening to
  > brace thin vaults. But it was chiefly during construction of these
  > vaults that such ribs were useful ...* [@choisy:1899histoire v. 2, p. 150,
  > my translation]

![Romanesque ribbed vaults, from Auguste Choisy's *Histoire de l'architecture* 148--50 (1899)](media/figure-6.tif){#fig:choisy}

In each case, the description of a motif (roman text) was followed by a
rationale for its existence, in the form of a problem this motif solved
(italicized text). This rationale was alternatively aesthetic,
functional, or structural. Each writer deployed all three kinds of
justifications at different places. Ultimately, the hierarchy of styles
in their textbooks followed not just Eurocentric prejudice, but each
author's judgment as to the usefulness of their examples for modern
professional practice. Thus, Fergusson and Choisy included the
Mediterranean Islamic tradition within the historical development of
Western architecture, whereas Fletcher consigned it to the
"non-historical styles."

Comparative historians made self-conscious choices in how to approach
their subject matter. Their outlook on history was avowedly disciplinary
and internalist: the broader natural and social context was invoked to
coalesce on how architects responded to them by means of specific design
decisions. Moreover, they emphasized the emergence of the discipline of
architecture through the evolution of structural and
decorative devices. In this sense, then, comparative histories of
architecture were not so much *history* as they were *architecture*.
That their examples happened to have been built in the past was
incidental;
the anachronistic comparison between ancient traditions and modern
design was admitted for its usefulness as a teaching device.

# Critical history and the global textbook #

Comparative histories of architecture fit their intended purpose
in the context of professional education and practice in
19^th^-century Europe. However, they rested on a dubious premise:
the assumption that the problem-solving methods of builders in the past
could be likened to the modern design process of the Western architect.

Critics were attacking this assumption decades before the comparative
histories' colonialist underpinnings would even come under scrutiny.
This tension was already latent before the end of the 19^th^ century.
John @summerson:1963heavenly pointed out architects of the Victorian era
were unique in that they questioned the legitimacy of their own style
[see also @pevsner:1972architectural]. One of these architects, John
@ruskin:1851stones had even intuited that the mindset of the medieval
builder was inaccessible to the modern architect---a core element of how
critical history operates. This insecurity carried on through the heyday
of modernism [@wigley:2000architectural94] and was compounded by the
unstable disciplinary boundaries of architecture
[@baydar:1998postcolonial].

Contradictory as that operative premise was, it could not have
contributed to the decline of comparative history were it not for the
specialization of architectural history scholarship in the postwar
years. Critical historians such as Tafuri and Reyner @banham:1960theory
shunned the operative interest in reclaiming certain aspects of the past.
A growing number of dedicated scholars followed suit, especially
in the Americas.

The consolidation of critical history was accompanied by faltering
interest in the architectural history textbook, at least in Northern
Europe and the United States. The last running edition of Choisy's
*Histoire de l'architecture* dated from 1964, at a time when it was
still the authoritative textbook at the École des Beaux-Arts.[^3]
Fletcher's book was last issued in the form devised by its original
authors in 1961. According to @hoekstra:2014modernity2 [25.1],
"the new ideal was that history ought to be an agent of
disjunction where the emphasis was on analysis rather than on synthesis."

[^3]: @choisy:1964histoire; a facsimilar edition was issued by Le Moniteur
    for the first edition's hundredth anniversary in 1999.

Whether it was realistic to expect an architectural history curriculum to
be predicated on fragments is a different story. The definition of
history as a constant rearrangement of fragments [@bann:1987clio23;
@tafuri:1977storico, 18] is certainly correct from the perspective of
how original research works. However, those who put forward this notion,
and who rearranged these fragments deftly, were themselves educated on
the synthetic view of the past practiced by the comparative method.

Moreover, the humanistic ideal of architecture education in the Americas
and the Iberian peninsula continued to demand some sort of broad outline
of the past. Spiro Kostof's 1985 *History of Architecture*
[@kostof:1985history] was a transitional attempt at reconciling the
comparative history focused on the development of the Greco-Roman
tradition with an awareness that this tradition was not isolated from
non-Western cultures.

Dispelling the belief in a universal standard for assessing different
cultures was one major contribution of critical history. Kostof's
textbooks were still tentative in this respect.
The Cypriot architectural historian Panayiota @pyla:1999historicizing52
[218-219] pointed out that Kostof still used
"Renaissance architecture as a yardstick" against which to assess other
building cultures, and that he showed little interest in those where interaction
with Europe had been limited.

Pyla wrote her article on Kostof while a doctoral researcher under Mark
Jarzombek at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; both
Cambridge-based universities, the [MIT]{.smallcaps} and Harvard, have
been hotbeds of thinking about critical perspectives in
architectural history beyond the Western canon.
A research circle at the [MIT]{.smallcaps} in the
1990s and early 2000s brought about in 2007 the textbook *A Global
History of Architecture*. Mark Jarzombek and another
of his former doctoral advisees, Virkamāditya Prakāsh, co-authored the
book together with Francis D. K. Ching, whom Prakāsh had joined as
faculty member of Washington University.

Jarzombek went on to explain that what spurred his *Global
History of Architecture* was an explicit
rejection of the "globalized" appropriation of architecture as a diverse
collection of national histories [@jarzombek:2015architecture, 112].
This claim can be likened to an earlier argument by Sibel Bozdoğan---who
has been affiliated with both the [MIT]{.smallcaps} and Harvard---on the
opposition between difference and diversity in the architectural history
survey [@bozdogan:1999architectural, 209]. Postcolonial criticism,
Bozdoğan had written, resists naturalizing cultural differences as an
ethnographic exhibition of diversity [@bozdogan:1999architectural, 210].

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Given this genealogy of critical approaches to global history, let us
look at how *A Global History* presented its subject matter. At first
sight, it would seem the authors of *A Global History* went for just
that kind of "encyclopaedic" diversity Jarzombek rejected
[@jarzombek:2015architecture, 112]. It seemed to string together discrete examples in
simple chronological order, under chapter headings with numbered years
rather than named culture--epochs. The actual structure of the book,
however, had a clear goal beneath this surface. To understand what it
was, one must look at the market it was designed for.

Carla Keyvanian, a professor of architectural history at Auburn
University, stated that a legitimate goal for history teaching in
professional programs in the United States was to emphasize "how
architectural transformations emerged from the search for structural and
formal solutions to limitations imposed by existing technology"
[@keyvanian:2011teaching64, 30]. This sounds eerily like Banister
Fletcher's distinction between "historical" and "non-historical" styles
on the basis of the development of structural and formal solutions
through time. Yet, Keyvanian argued, this was a necessary accommodation
for students in professional architecture programs that included
extensive history coursework as part of a humanistic emphasis.

*A Global History of Architecture* was therefore a disciplinary textbook aimed at
just the same humanistic bent in professional curricula of architecture
schools in the Americas that Keyvanian has worked with. As such, it
compromised critical scholarship by seeking to establish a
narrative that would make sense to an audience of undergraduate
students. Now keep in mind that the book's authors had been educated
under the comparative method: they could make sense of the juxtaposition
of fragmentary information thanks to their memory of the very
comparative system they were working to dismantle.

Students making their first contact with architectural history through
*A Global History* would not, however, have the same knowledge.
Therefore, its authors tempered the innovativeness of the book's
discrete examples with the Western historicist
idea that a timeline is an intrinsically
meaningful way of presenting content. Even though
*A Global History*'s chapter headings seem to be a pure and neutral
timeline, upon closer inspection, it shows that they might as well have
been modeled after
conventional epochs in European art history ([@tbl:epochs]).

@tafuri:1991introduzione [7] argued that the abuse of architectural
history in design bred "reckless iconology and anachronism." Conversely,
*A Global History*'s authors shunned stylistic analysis in
general, including iconology. Still, they fell into the anachronistic pitfall
of taking linear time to be the one legitimate source of meaning for all the
world. This textbook projected backwards the contemporary anxiety about
essentializing non-Western traditions, and in so doing neutralized the
difference between the historicist societies arising in Early Modern
Eurasia and others having different understandings of cultural
transmission and change through time.

@baydar:1998postcolonial [13] criticized the heavily refactored recent
editions of Fletcher's *History of Architecture* for reducing both
so-called "Western" and "non-Western" societies to the single yardstick
of a unified timeline. *A Global History* took the same approach, with
similar conceptual problems arising from it. Beyond the truism that
linear time is itself a "Western" concept, it is, more importantly, a
*modern* concept. @heynen:1999architecture [10] equated the attribution
of intrinsic meaning to the passage of time with the rise of modernity
as a worldview. Understanding modernity as a precondition for the
legitimacy of linear-time historiography is key to grasping the current
drift in both the scholarship of architectural history as well as the
scope of (text)book writing.

# Non-disciplinary history and disciplinary theory #

Kathleen James-Chakraborty avoided shoehorning unrelated cultures into a timeline
in her book *Architecture since 1400*. She did so by explicitly
restricting her work to a time period and cultural universe where
historicism was (mostly) a legitimate interpretive frame. The "basic
premise" of her book was that 1400 marked an epoch when several Eurasian
cultures were increasingly aware of and anxious about the meaning
of their own history. This in turn came to bear on their architectural
theory and practice [@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, xvii].

This insight freed her to leverage the methodological
resources of current historiography without the risk of anachronism.
Her second premise was that architecture did not result solely from
great artists and their patrons, but from a conversation among many social
actors [@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, xviii]. This followed neatly
from the core "project" of critical history as formulated by
@tafuri:1977storico: to
sever the link of architectural history with the contemporary
understanding of the architectural profession. James-Chakraborty's book
thus stands arguably as the first textbook to make no compromise with
the comparative method.

We already looked at Baydar's argument as to why the disciplinary
conditioning of architectural history was problematic. Tafuri had
dismissed the visual analysis of architecture, the disciplinary toolkit
*par excellence*. He deemed it hopelessly bound by whichever
ideological system was current. In
contrast, he claimed, the complex web of relations that made up the
productive system of architecture could only be critiqued in the non-visual
terms of relations of production (of the built environment and of
ideology) [@tafuri:1980sfera, 22; authors such as @hartoonian:2018time
have called into question Tafuri's excessive reliance on materialism.].
James-Chakraborty heeded this lesson, downplaying reliance on images to
understand the social
role of buildings. While showing a painting of the Gate of Felicity
in Topkapı palace, she said
"it may not seem particularly imposing, but that is because architecture
was never the whole story here"
[@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, 95].

*Architecture since 1400* thus was, true to its critical premises, history
*through* architecture more than history *of* architecture.
Decreased reliance on visual analysis in turn opened up narrative
possibilities that resulted in subtler connections. The author
showed, according to @hirsh:2017review76 [242], how cultural transfer
often flowed counter to Eurocentric historiography's assumptions. This
said, some connections were so distant both materially and conceptually as
to look like inconsequential literary devices. Consider, for example, this
account of Versailles in confrontation with other site plans of its age:

> If Bess’s gaze out from the long gallery of Hardwick Hall gave her
> command of the surrounding territory, and Shah Abbas viewed the
> proceedings on the Maidan from the Ali Qapu, on how much greater a
> scale could Louis XIV look out over his dominion...
> [@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, 163]

While *A Global History* fell for the illusion of narrative neutrality,
*Architecture since 1400* fell into the methodological trap of
discounting its very subject matter. More than a decade before its
publication, @albrecht:2002interpretation55 [194], following Susan Sontag, regretted that,
in the current critical landscape, "even if the building has received
attention, it is ultimately the interpretation and not the building that
is of interest." James-Chakraborty
is a far more rigorous scholar than those theorists Albrecht was aiming his guns
at. Still, for all her decentering of European assumptions, her book's
crowning premise sounds oddly Idealistic: "rather than merely reflecting
culture, architecture contributes to crafting it"
[@james-chakraborty:2014architecture, xix].

*Architecture since 1400* consistently downplayed the disciplinary aspects of
practice---visual composition and professional tradition---, so how could it
define an architecture that crafts culture and is not itself this
culture? It must be the abstract ideas shuttling back and forth
between architectural theory and other social actors. The precedence of
the avant-garde (chapter 22) over mass culture (chapter 23) made the
author's intent clear in this respect.

What tied together *Architecture since
1400* was the assumption that modernization and historicism were
common features of many of the building cultures described in the book.
This assumption, however, was Idealistic and teleological.
Behind its critical method lay a philosophy of history, namely,
that modernization and historicism legitimated a transcendental concept
of architecture [@hoekstra:2014modernity2, 2].

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

James-Chakraborty's book was not the sole work placing modernization at
the center of its concept of architectural history. This trope has become so
prevalent in recent scholarship that @jarzombek:2015architecture
[119] bemoaned the fact that "architectural history---the
discipline---has almost become a code word for the history of
modernism." Conversely, the hegemonic understanding of modernization has
rekindled Eurocentrism in architectural history.

We have already seen how Heynen's aforementioned concept of modernization
explicitly stated that linear history is a modern and Western
invention. She also structured her book *Architecture and
Modernity* around the notion that modernism
was entangled with "the bourgeois modernity of capitalist civilization"
[@heynen:1999architecture, 12]. Throughout her book, it was implied that
the culture of bourgeois capitalism
was also a monolithic Northwestern European creation, leaving the rest
of the world as a mere receiver and adapter of this culture. Thus, the entire
intellectual debate around modernity she discussed in her book has
played out in a handful of European and New England universities.

Because Heynen's book gave such a thorough and insightful account of
this debate, however, its insidious Eurocentrism has become somewhat
normalized in the global thinking about the nature of architectural
history. This has been compounded by the lesser ability of architecture
schools and publishers in the global South to sustain an autonomous
market for original textbooks, relying instead to a great extent on
translations from North American and European works.

Moreover, in Latin
America the conceptual toolkit for writing such an autonomous body of
architectural history was developed roughly at the same time as the
distrust of comparative histories and of textbook syntheses became
entrenched in the universities. It is not surprising, then, that the
first textbook on the architectural history of the Americas as a whole
was a work by Iowa State University professor Clare Cardinal-Pett, the
2016 book *A History of Architecture and Urbanism in the Americas*
[@cardinal-pett:2016history].

Cardinal-Pett's book combined the mostly chronological structure already
seen in *A Global History*, rejecting the traditional scheme of native American
culture--areas, with a more conventional narrative text. The latter
enabled her to adopt, in some places, the critical approach
characteristic of *Architecture since 1400*. Rather than delving deep
into Cardinal-Pett's content, at the risk of repeating much of was has
already been said about the other two textbooks, then, let us look
briefly at a domain where a few South American scholars have made an
original contribution.

The dichotomy of Theory and History of Architecture was popularized by
@tafuri:1968teorie in his eponymous 1968 book. While theory and history
have remained, at Tafuri's behest, largely separate in Europe, in the
Americas and the Iberian peninsula they are united in the names of
countless departments, courses, and research tracks in architecture
schools. The drift of architectural[^2] history scholarship away from
premodern periods has, however, created a contradiction with
undergraduate teaching, which has continued to cover a broad
chronological survey. To some extent, this led to a number of
architecture faculty deserting history altogether: the Portuguese
professor José Pedro @tenreiro:2023fall [217] claimed that "those who were attached
to architectural history for political reasons now prefer theory."

[^2]: This is not the case for urban history, which in Latin America has
    a well established track record of specialized scholarship encompassing the
    Precolumbian and Colonial periods as well as the more recent past.
    However, urban history generally has a lesser bearing on the
    professional education of architects. See, for example,
    @fridman:2013cidades.

In South America, however, many went on to ponder instead *what*
theory was required for the history of architecture they were teaching.
Argentinian professor Marina Waisman gave an early and influential
response to this question. The title of her 1990 book *El interior de la
historia*  was a play on the concept of "intra-history" coined by
Spanish literary historian Miguel de @unamuno:1902torno and transposed to
architecture by the urban historian Fernando Chueca Goitia
[@waisman:1993interior, 54; see @chuecagoitia:1981invariantes-castizos].
The latter meant the history of lesser places and lives, often unnoticed
by historians before the mid 20^th^ century and, more importantly,
forming a slow-moving undercurrent outlasting the faster changes in
elite art. Waisman's book had the subtitle "architectural historiography
for use by Latin Americans", so it was not at all a textbook but a
statement on the theory of architectural history.

Though Waisman purported to assemble her thoughts on the specificity of
the Latin American context in which to write architectural history,
her argument ended up being more of a reflection on the
specificity of architectural history as a methodological field. Without
folding back into the disciplinary character of comparative history,
this entailed nonetheless an Idealist frame of mind. Waisman proposed a
fixed set of themes that ought to supersede conventional
stylistic periods or even simple chronology as tools for historical
interpretation. This was reminiscent of Wölfflin's *Principles*
[-@woelfflin:1950principles] and, by her recurring admonition to
relate history to current urban planning problems, of Bruno Zevi's
operative history. Although the title of
Waisman's book alluded to unchanging cultural features going against the
grain of a historiography usually concerned with change itself, then,
her argument came back to the teleological supremacy of present
professional needs.

The persistence of Idealist underpinnings in Latin American theories of
architectural history such as Waisman's confirms to this day Tafuri's
admonition against the pitfalls of doing "Theory and History", though it
is by no means restricted to Latin America. @keyvanian:2011teaching64
[32] touted more recently the merits of "emphasizing the relevance of
historical precedents ... in assembling lessons of theoretical
significance." Her career in the United States underscores the practical
limits of critical scholarship when faced with the task of teaching in
professional programs and how this task tends to favor the creep of
Idealism back into critical history.

# Disciplinary tools in (or around) critical history #

So far, we have looked at how the disciplinary, totalizing method of
comparative histories harbored intrinsic contradictions. Critical
history has exposed this method and replaced it with a provisional assemblage of
fragmentary subject matter. We have also seen how architectural history
textbooks crafted for professional education have struggled to evade the
determinism of the comparative approach, even when the critical method
underpinned their premises. This process thus represents an incomplete
transition from the study of buildings within the disciplinary framework
of architecture, and towards a non-disciplinary historiographic ideal of
the past as an entirely textual construct.

One of few critical scholars who endeavored to flesh out a method to
address this incompleteness is
the Brazilian architectural historian Gustavo Rocha-Peixoto. Shunning
Idealism in all its forms and being wary of a strict mapping of critical
research methods onto survey teaching, he described in his 2011 book
*The Spider's Stratagem* a heuristics for the historical education of
architecture students.

In Tafuri's historiography, critical history was a safeguard against the disciplinary
aporia of Theory and History; in Rocha-Peixoto's, then, critical history
had definitely exorcized that aporia by subsuming Theory under History
[@rocha-peixoto:2013spiders, 80]. Because theory was no longer a threat
to proper historiography, Rocha-Peixoto's historical pedagogy could engage
with professional education by means of creative associations that may
comprise disciplinary tools yet was not constrained by disciplinary
demands. To complete the aforementioned transition towards an
understanding of the past as a fully malleable construct, it is the
distinction itself between disciplinary (professional) and
non-disciplinary (historiographic) interests that needs to be erased.

This transition, however, will be ever incomplete insofar as
non-disciplinary, critical history depends on physical evidence produced
by disciplinary fields. Tafuri himself
made clear, in his later writings, that architectural
history must reach beyond a generic commitment to the critical treatment
of documentary evidence, and rely on some sort of disciplinary training
that could address the problem of "*which* philology for
*this* particular subject" [@tafuri:1991introduzione, 7-8, his italics].

The philological framework architectural history is built on lies nowadays,
to a great extent, in the disciplinary field of building archaeology. It
is a specialization that arose with the name of *Bauforschung* (building
research or scholarship) in late 19^th^-century Germany. To its early
practitioners such as Wilhelm Dörpfeld [@sapirstein:2016columns120] and
Josef Durm [@durm:1905baukunst; -@durm:1910baukunst], *Bauforschung*
provided solid evidence as opposed to the questionable interpretations
of stylistic analysis [@azkarate:2020archaeology, 526]. Building
archaeology arose out of a critical view of
history and a rejection of comparative studies. Nevertheless, it is
still a form of primarily architectural scholarship, and continues to be
taught in German-speaking countries as part of a professional curriculum
in architecture [@neumann:2002teaching, 374-5].
Since the 1950s, stratigraphy has contributed a great deal to the current
methodological makeup of building archaeology and to the near complete
abandonment of stylistic analysis as a means of dating buildings
[@azkarate:2020archaeology, 521].

Architectural history still needs to come to terms more fully with the
disciplinary character of building archaeology [@perotti:2001archeologia, 379].
The field of construction history, for one, has welcomed disciplinary studies as
specific as the structural calculation of traditional components
[@dacunto:2019vector-based167]. Textual criticism, on the other hand,
still allows the historian the comfortable position of working with a
past that can never be truly actualized, rather than with the unsettling
perspective of a historic building looming over the present.

However, building archaeology is still the study of buildings from the
past, with the incidental task of supporting conservation. It might even
be discounted as a supporting discipline of heritage conservation rather
than as historical scholarship on its own right. On a political level,
@tenreiro:2023fall [223] argued, the pedagogical emphasis on
construction history was a way of hollowing out the critical content of
architectural history.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Vernacular architecture
studies, on the other hand, add a layer of complication to the issue of
whether historical criticism can be embedded in a disciplinary setting.
Vernacular architecture has often been viewed as an
intrinsically operative, and therefore disciplinary, field. First, it
deals with social subjects that are not safely stationed in the past,
but continue into the present and look towards the future
[@vellinga:2006engaging, 83]. Second, this continuity means scholarship
often ends up entangled with building practice, both in experimental
settings and as part of social activism [@ozkan:2006traditionalism,
104--106].

This would seem to invalidate any claim that vernacular
architecture studies might be a form of history, considering Tafuri's
assertion that there can be no such thing as operative history
[@tafuri:1988teorie, 263]. However, vernacular architecture studies
arose unquestionably from a critical framework. Contemporary interest in
vernacular built environments stems from anthropological studies in the
1960s and 70s [@ara:2016imaging21, 174], notably those of
Amos @rapoport:1969house, Henry @glassie:1976folk, and Paul
@oliver:2006built. Since then, scholars of vernacular
buildings have increasingly claimed historical status for their
research, for much the same reasons as building archaeology
[@carter:1991introduction4]. Architectural anthropology may still deal,
to some degree, with present-day societies, but it no longer assumes any
timeless quality in culture. Instead, it actively engages with cultural
change in historical time, and does so with a critical outlook in each
society's own terms [@egenter:1980bauform, 12].

An even stronger claim for melding critical history and disciplinary
insertion lies in the archaeology of architecture, a field that deals
chiefly with the same vernacular built environment as architectural
anthropology. Somewhat confusingly, the archaeology of architecture
is not related to building archaeology.
Whereas building archaeology is chiefly concerned with
ascertaining the physical process of buildings through time, the
archaeology of architecture deals with the full range of human dwelling.

The "fog" that Mikkel Bille and Tim Sørensen invoked to define the
archaeology of architecture [@bille:2016fog, 1] is precisely the
ever-changing critical landscape of history adapting its methods to both
its discrete objects of study and contemporary research interests that
Tafuri posited for architectural history. Archaeologies of architecture
are critical endeavors committed to constantly unsettling established
pictures of past societies and do not restrict themselves to a
contemporary definition of architecture [A comprehensive showcase can be
found in @kent:2001domestic]. Still, they do so by leveraging analytical
skills that pertain to the contemporary professional discipline of
architecture, including the study of functional and symbolic programs,
spatial hierarchies, and even the reconstruction of the climate inside
and around buildings [For a systematic review of these and many other
variables, see @steadman:2015archaeology].

The disciplinary affiliation of the study of vernacular buildings to the
professional domain of architecture is necessary to provide the
appropriate philological toolkit. Nevertheless, it is not without its
own contradictions. Historic preservation and the practice of
traditional or sustainable architecture [@memmott:2015redefining58] are
the operative branches of building archaeology, the archaeology of
architecture, and the study of vernacular environments. As we saw above, Jarzombek
denounced that critical history increasingly confines itself to the
study of historicist societies, and of modernism in particular
[@ching:2007global, 118]. The operative disciplines, he continued, took
over the vacuum left in the scholarship of premodern or traditional
architecture with a supposedly preconceived interest in local or
national identities [@jarzombek:2015architecture, 118]---identities that
are indebted to the Idealist philosophy of history. Jarzombek thus
echoed Tafuri in arguing global (critical) history is "not a discipline"
but "an accusation" tasked with exposing "the epistemological regimes...
[of] practices that lie at the core of the architectural world"
[@jarzombek:2015architecture, 119].

<!--Solution de continuité-->

This anti-disciplinary task, however, is bound up with the historicist
problems of Early Modern and Modern societies. @stoppani:2010lhistoire [216]
showed how Tafuri's own interest in the Italian Renaissance hinged on
"unresolved problems" linking the historical subject to contemporary
theoretical anxieties. Because of this,
such a critical history program would feed back inevitably into that loop of
Early Modern to Modernist historiography. This in turn reduced critical
historians' interest in premodern architecture, and left the field
open to disciplinary studies. Critical history pries time apart to
recompose its fragments, at the cost of favoring subjects where the
problem of historical time is explicit. Disciplinary studies in
architecture, on the other hand, collapse time into a synthetic present, at the cost of
projecting current categories onto subjects to which they are foreign.
The Marxist ideal that this contradiction will be overcome once every
disciplinary specialization is diluted into "abstract... technical
labor" [@tafuri:1980sfera, 28] shows no sign of coming to pass.

The latest editions of Banister Fletcher's textbook have
attempted to break free from synthesis by shunning the narrative
unity provided by coherent authorship in favor of isolated chapters
written by specialists. This is unusual in the textbook genre and found
more often in *Companions* [@mallgrave:2017companions], although the
SmartHistory project *Reframing Art History* is another, promising
example of this approach [@reframing:2022].
However, critical history of architecture today functions
in a broad landscape where it interacts with other, more or less
disciplinary fields. The points of contact between these disciplines
and history expose conflicts between the philological toolkit drawn from
the professional field of architecture and history's critical project of
steering away from disciplinary boundaries and unitary narratives.

# Conclusion #

Despite the ever widening reach of materialist criticism, then, Idealist philosophies
of history have kept creeping into architectural scholarship. This may stem
from critical history deserting certain subjects or rejecting
contamination by operative requirements. In other cases, however,
Idealism has shown through unstated assumptions or expedients in works that
outwardly claimed a critical method. Architectural history textbooks are
at the core of the contradictions between the emergence of critical
historiography and the survival of Idealism. Historical criticism can
afford to be restricted by no preordained disciplinary boundaries, yet
history in a professional education curriculum is typically expected to
play a specific disciplinary part, even if only that of fostering an
ability to talk about architecture. More insidiously, it is history that
has often been leveraged to circumscribe what is or is not architecture.

This discussion led from the 19^th^-century comparative histories of
architecture, openly predicated on an Idealistic philosophy of history
but also explicitly disciplinary, to the 21^st^-century global histories
of architecture that rejected the deterministic, Eurocentric categories
and evolutionary paradigm of comparative histories. We thus saw
how two recent textbooks, *A Global History of Architecture* and
*Architecture since 1400*, sought to dismantle deterministic narratives
while filling the market niche of the humanistic architectural education
prevalent in the Americas.
Even as these two books explicitly rejected the Eurocentric *argument* for
an evolutionist history, their approaches to collecting buildings and
societies upheld the Eurocentric *structure* of a universal architecture
determined by the historicist framework of change through linear time.

These architectural history textbooks offered a picture of meaningful
cultural change through time by means of examples drawn from architecture. In so
doing, they established dubious relationships with comparative histories
such as James Fergusson's, Banister Fletcher's, and Auguste Choisy's.
These comparative histories delimited the disciplinary scope of
architecture by signaling, through historical examples, how
19^th^-century Europeans understood the professional work of designing
buildings. In contrast, global histories of architecture portrayed
buildings as being rendered meaningful through change over time: design
not as professional agency, but as a reflection of society. In so doing,
global histories heeded the critical project of decentering the
modern disciplinary boundaries, but at the cost of giving an afterlife
to the comparative histories' premise of time as a teleological arrow,
within which only structural change could be meaningful.

On the other hand, the critical history of architecture today functions
in a broad landscape where it interacts with other, more or less
disciplinary fields, such as building archaeology, the archaeology or
anthropology of architecture, and the study of vernacular built
environments. The points of contact between these quasi-historical disciplines
and history proper highlight conflicts between the analytical toolkit drawn from
the professional field of architecture and history's critical project of
steering away from disciplinary determinations. On the one hand,
engaging with these disciplines as supporting fields provides history
with the sources necessary for constructing its narratives; on the other
hand, it forces history to contend with the nature of disciplinary
knowledge and its relation to time. This contention has been somewhat
disorienting in the methods of architectural history, and the all too
common retreat into pure textual criticism offers a convenient but
unsatisfactory reaction to it.

Much of the disciplinary knowledge about buildings of the past does not,
indeed, make the cut of critical history. This knowledge, however,
continues to provide source material for writing histories of
architecture that pride themselves on a critical perspective. The
contradiction between both domains may well be inescapable, inasmuch as
the synthetic interpretations of fields such as building archaeology
cannot but collapse the historical object onto the observable present,
whereas historical criticism functions in the opposite way, prying
ourselves apart from the past to expose it as an irreconcilable
difference. Even so, architectural history must come to terms with the
legitimacy of disciplinary knowledge about the architectural past. Failure
to do so has led not only to an uneasy coexistence between history and
its supporting fields, but even to the continued creeping of Idealist
assumptions into historical narratives.
