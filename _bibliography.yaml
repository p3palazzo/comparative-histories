    This article comparatively discusses the 14th International Architecture
    Biennale of Venice, directed by Rem Koolhaas, and the pilot exhibit and
    architectural design of Louvre Abu Dhabi undertaken by Jean Nouvel, in the
    context of recent big art events and world museums. Curatorial,
    historiographical, and installation strategies in these venues are
    differentiated in order to think through the question of displaying a global
    history of architecture. I make a distinction between the curatorial
    practices carried out in the Fundamentals and Absorbing Modernity sections
    of Venice's Central and National Pavilions as curator-as-author and
    curators-as-chorus, which I map onto recent historiographical and museum
    design practices, including the Louvre Abu Dhabi, to discuss the
    geopolitical implications of its installation strategies. I also argue that
    six methodological perspectives for displaying architectural history emerge
    from the curator-chorus of Absorbing Modernity, which can be identified as
    survey, nationalist history, case study, thematic history, archive metaphor,
    and deferment, all of which contribute to and raise questions about the
    ongoing project towards a global architectural history. After suggesting a
    difference between “world” and “global” history of architecture, I call for
    a more geopolitically conscious and cosmopolitan global history of
    architecture, by exposing the intactive bonds between the history of
    modernism and of colonization, as well as the continuing legacy of
    geopolitical and economic inequalities that operate in such venues.

  abstract: >-
    Ethnographic surveys of building processes rarely feature in mainstream
    architectural history. The curious dearth of studies derives perhaps more
    from the absence of a relevant methodological orientation and
    cross-disciplinary collaboration than a lack of serious interest in the
    building process itself. By drawing on building methods and know-how from an
    oral culture, in this essay, we propose that sentient building processes are
    useful means for constructing one seamless history that transcends limited
    disciplinary representations. We also pursue the possibilities of
    collaboration on ethnographic knowledge across vernacular architecture and
    anthropology. The essay discusses concepts and methods including visual
    methods. Informed by current anthropology, images are additionally utilised
    to interpret architectural temporality, a biographical view of dwelling,
    situated learning, technology–culture non-duality, and socio-spatial
    references. By intertwining a cross-disciplinary methodological position
    with methodological techniques and by tying conditions and potentials of
    human life to the very act of building, concerning an indigenous culture
    without any written history, we advocate vernacular architecture’s potential
    to complement mainstream architectural history.

    This book examines the career and publications of the French architect
    Julien-David Leroy (1724–1803) and his impact on architectural theory and
    pedagogy.  Despite not leaving any built work, Leroy is a major
    international figure of eighteenth-century architectural theory and culture.
    Considering the place that Leroy occupied in various intellectual circles of
    the Enlightenment and Revolutionary period, this book examines the sources
    for his ideas about architectural history and theory and defines his impact
    on subsequent architectural thought. This book will be of key interest to
    graduate students and scholars of Enlightenment-era architectural history.

  abstract: >-
    This paper addresses the problem of interpreting the concepts of tradition
    and traditionalism with specific reference to the tradition of the Anatolian
    house and the recent erosion of place quality in Turkish towns. The
    Anatolian house provides a remarkable example of cultural diffusion and
    transformation. During the reign of the late Ottoman, a variety of cultures
    impinged on one another, giving rise to autochthonous traditions that were
    shared by different religious and ethnic groups. But during the Republican
    Period the process of Westernization interrupted the continuity of historic
    traditions, resulting in the emergence of a peculiar contemporary tradition.
    The majority of Turkish housing today displays characteristics of a
    "vernacular modernism" conditioned by the moral and technical orders of a
    market economy. The worldwide spread of such cultural mediocrity has often
    been attributed to the corrosive influence of a single world civilization. A
    number of recent attempts have been made to search for a national idiom in
    Turkey. But these attempts, often promoting a "vernacular historicism," have
    yet to account for any distinct revision of urban house-form. Argument today
    revolves around an old rhetorical opposition between universal civilization
    and national culture. Should a post-traditional society sustain its cultural
    tradition to attain universal values, or vice-versa? The conservative in
    this debate is more involved in the revival than in the preservation of
    tradition. The progressive, though an ardent defender of preservation,
    resists revivalism because of its chauvinistic connotations and pastiche
    effects. This paper attempts to resolve this argument by suggesting a
    simultaneous unfolding of the historical problems of the Anatolian house
    tradition and the theoretical problems of presumed dichotomies such as
    "traditional vs. modern." Finally, the paper advocates the development of
    research strategies to facilitate correct readings of cultural tradition and
    design strategies to improve the quality of residential environments.

    Under the same name – archaeology of architecture/building archaeology –
    there exist very different schools which frequently work in parallel,
    mutually ignoring one another: the European tradition, more stratigraphic
    and committed to knowledge, protection and dissemination of built heritage;
    the North American tradition –and English-speaking in general – more
    oriented, based on very different theoretical perspectives, to the
    archaeology of houses and households; and Latin American archaeology, more
    syncretic, open and permeable to different influences. This chapter presents
    an insight into all three, concluding with a call for a flexible and, above
    all, far more socially committed archaeology of global architecture.

  abstract: >-
    The building industry's organization has been relatively invariant down
    through history due to housing's unique characteristics: durability, fixity
    in location, complex co-ordination of various trades on site and financing
    its great costs. That organizational form has allowed speculative
    development to flourish periodically during large increases in urban
    population, despite considerable risk. The same building and speculative
    processes occurred in ancient Rome and cities in England and the US at
    greatly different periods of time but those histories do not acknowledge the
    similarities of development processes that each reports. A separate 'housing
    literature' that steps back from particulars possibly explains why these
    accounts are so alike.

    Current teaching methods for architectural history seldom embrace building
    technology as an essential component of study. Accepting the premise that
    architectural history is a fundamental component to the overall
    architectural learning environment, it is argued that the study of
    construction history will further enhance student knowledge. This hypothesis
    created an opportunity to investigate how the study of construction history
    could be incorporated to strengthen present teaching methods. Strategies for
    teaching architectural history were analyzed with the determination that an
    incorporation of educational instructional design applications using
    object-oriented programming and hypermedia provided the optimal solution.
    This evaluation led to the development of the HISTCON interactive,
    multimedia educational computer program. Used initially to teach 19th
    Century iron and steel construction history, the composition of the program
    provides the mechanism to test the significance of construction history in
    the study of architectural history. Future development of the program will
    provide a method to illustrate construction history throughout the history
    of architecture. The study of architectural history, using a construction
    oriented methodology, is shown to be positively correlated to increased
    understanding of architectural components relevant to architectural history
    and building construction.

  abstract: >-
    The provision of adequate quality housing for the mass population has always
    been the major challenge for a rapidly developing country like Malaysia. As
    the country heads towards higher level of urbanization, it is expected to
    face accelerated demand on housing and the associated environmental impacts.
    Only by encouraging the development of more eficient buildings or through
    implementing a holistic construction approach that addressed right from the
    onset of the design stage, harmful environmental impact to the surroundings
    can be mitigated. This paper highlights the potential of applying lexibility
    – a design approach which has been widely adopted in the traditional
    construction – as an inherent design strategy for the modern urban mass
    housing. The proposed design strategy entails open plan that enable retroit
    and reconiguration to be made quickly, economically, and repeatedly, without
    involving excessive site labour, time, and cost; as compared to the
    currently adopted design strategy which is associated with rigid structure,
    interlocking plan, and predetermined function. It makes possible the
    creation of dwellings which may grow old yet without becoming obsolete;
    incorporating the latest design ideas and technologies, yet have a sense of
    history on the Malaysian housing design (the rumah kampung design); allowing
    the communities to live for generations, yet incorporating the potential of
    adaptation. By examining the background research and the fundamental design
    principles, the paper suggests that only dwellings with high degree of
    lexibility may enable the integration of dual aims and principles of
    affordability and sustainability in mass housing, thereby facilitating the
    movement of the country’s construction industry towards mechanization,
    industrialization, and standardization.

    From the seventeenth century onwards, the systematic discovery of the lands
    to the east of Europe gradually established the Orient as the subject matter
    of representation--of illustrated travel accounts, etchings, engravings,
    paintings and sketches. This needs to be seen as part of a larger historical
    episode which has installed representation as the principal construct of
    knowledge in Western culture. The Orient is thereby objectified into a form
    of discourse, as Edward Said has brilliantly shown us, as well as into a
    stereotypical image for consumption and a stylistic category in
    architecture. Through a critique of Orientalist constructs, this paper
    intends to draw attention to an alternative way of looking at the Orient:
    one that does not turn it into an independent, frozen reality outside the
    self-knowing subject, but instead, enters into its world, engages with it
    and employs representation as a critical/exploratory vehicle rather than an
    affirmative/expository one. It is in this sense that the experiential
    sketches and scribbles of Le Corbusier in his "Journey to the East" offer us
    some insight the implications of which are highly significant and relevant
    for the current architectural culture at large.

    In recent years, our inherited architectural culture, which privileges the
    autonomy of form and the paradigmatic status of the western tradition, has
    been contested from a range of critical perspectives. In this article I
    address some of the new challenges that architectural history faces today
    and contemplate two questions with important implications for teaching
    survey courses. First, how does one make architectural history less
    Eurocentric and more cross-cultural without either naturalizing the cultural
    difference of "others" or essentializing these differences into
    incommensurable categories? Second, how does one talk about the politics of
    architecture without reducing architecture to politics?

  abstract: >-
    In an effort to expand on the traditional rationalist interpretation of
    Viollet-le-Duc, this article explores his ideas of progress and history.
    Viollet's "reason" is described as a dialectical structure which develops in
    time, unfolding through history. From his description of the origins of
    architecture to his account of the great periods of mankind, Viollet's
    philosophy of history presents an ideology of freedom; and through it he
    attempts to demonstrate humanity's progressive transformation of a nature
    originally hostile to man into a new world in harmony with him. The
    historical dialectic follows three distinct stages: Asian civilization
    (theocraty), Antiquity (aristocraty) and finally Christianity (democraty),
    which is a synthesis of the previous two. Such trinitarian rule is basic to
    the dialectical process itself. It underlies not only Viollet's philosophy
    of history but also his philosophy of nature (theory of crystals). Technique
    is the realm of human activity which, for Viollet, best speaks of man's
    dialectical engagement with the world. Viollet's central notion of style
    defines a technical activity; an object endowed with style must result from
    the struggle between the real (the world of nature and tradition, the given
    facts from which human action starts out) and the ideal (the world of human
    aspirations and progress). Style is an expression of dialectical synthesis.
    It is in his description of the difference between Greek and Gothic
    architecture that Viollet's historical dialectic comes through most clearly.
    Greek architecture, for Viollet, is the first instance of an architecture
    which seeks to free itself from the enslavement to tradition. The static
    nature of Greek structural principles, however, still reflects a fatalistic
    vision of the world. In contrast, Gothic architecture is the birth of a
    radical spirit of invention which seeks to subjugate totally both nature and
    tradition. The principle of equilibrium basic to its structural organization
    is an example of man's cunning play with the forces of nature. It embodies
    the "Christian rule" which leaves to man his free will and the
    responsibility for his own works. Christianity is the last stage in the
    historical dialectic where man becomes "a creature in the image of the
    Creator."

  abstract: >-
    The current academic and popular interest in urban history is accompanied by
    methodological explorations. Paralleling the recent trends in social
    history, architectural historians working on urban topics have broadened the
    subject matter. They now investigate social, economic, political, and
    cultural issues to explain the built forms of cities, thereby relying on
    interdisciplinary research. The focus is often on urban transformations with
    a wide-spread concern to address the issues and problems of today and
    tomorrow through studying history. While the recent methodological search in
    urban history is rich and inspirational, it also bears shortcomings.
    Methodological pluralism can easily lead to a diminution of focus and a
    general ambiguity, obscuring evaluation standards. The approaches surveyed
    here display the widening perspectives, but also point to the importance of
    further theoretical and methodological discussion.

    This journal was founded seventy-four years ago with the ambition of
    launching a “new” architectural history and expanding the scope of the
    discipline. While the readership expanded in the next three decades, the
    confines of the field became increasingly narrow in the 1950s and 1960s.
    This was the subject of John Maass’s 1969 article that demonstrated the near
    absence of “non-Western” and “vernacular” topics in JSAH.1 This was followed
    a year later by Sibyl Moholy-Nagy’s acerbic criticism of the journal for
    promoting disciplinary obsolescence.2 Despite these consecutive depth
    charges that shattered SAH’s carapace of disciplinary ecumenism, both the
    society and the journal sailed seemingly untroubled into the next
    millennium.

    The two volumes of the twenty-first edition of Sir Banister Fletcher’s
    Global History of Architecture (henceforth Banister Fletcher’s Global
    History) are a sumptuous textual and visual banquet to delight varied
    tastes, with offerings that can be savored repeatedly over time, separately
    or, if desired, in their entirety. No matter where one enters the volumes,
    it is soon evident that this edition represents a boldly radical and welcome
    rethinking of Banister Fletcher (first published in 1896).1 For the first
    time, the word global enters the title, and more than any other worldwide
    architectural history survey to date, these volumes reveal a truly global
    architectural history beginning to take shape.

    Este libro constituye una primera recopilación de técnicas arqueométricas
    elementales, moleculares, de datación y de prospección, además de casos de
    estudio originales en los cuales la utilización de estos análisis contribuyó
    con resultados enriquecedores y significativos a la interpretación
    arqueológica de variadas dimensiones materiales y culturales de sociedades
    pasadas de América y de Europa. Esperamos que por ser el primer libro, en
    español, de síntesis de estas características, se genere un gran interés
    entre estudiantes, profesionales e investigadores, en sus variados procesos
    de formación e investigación, para que en el futuro incorporen estas
    herramientas y miradas arqueométricas a sus trabajos y a la resolución de
    sus problemas de estudio. Los 30 capítulos están estructurados en 3 partes:
    I) Técnicas, protocolos y aplicaciones; II) Materiales y casos de estudio; y
    finalmente, III) Técnicas de prospección en Arqueología. Los autores son
    destacados investigadores arqueólogos, físicos, químicos, biólogos y
    geógrafos de Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Estados Unidos, Francia, México y
    Perú.

  abstract: >-
    This essay explores Le Corbusier's debt to the nineteenth-century tradition
    of French Hellenism in the formulation of his vision for a new architecture,
    as reflected both in his polemical treatise, Vers une architecture (1923),
    and in his avant-garde Parisian villas of the 1920's. Two of Le Corbusier's
    principal interests - the architectural promenade, informed by the example
    of the Athenian Acropolis, and the Parthenon, appreciated as an aesthetic
    icon - derive from this tradition, which he received through the writings of
    Viollet-le-Duc and Auguste Choisy. These two theorists, moreover, are shown
    to have promoted ideas that belie their popular characterization today as
    "structural rationalists." Finally, it is suggested that the historical
    periods usually associated with what is known as the Modern Movement, seen
    as beginning toward either 1890 or 1920, are, rather, phases within a longer
    historical cycle, which originated with the Romantic revolution toward the
    1820's, when it became imperative to create a modern architecture expressive
    of contemporary culture.

    such a form that it may either be bound up as a third volume of the

    Architecture programs should include a curriculum on philosophy of
    architecture in the analytic philosophical tradition. I describe such a
    curriculum and distinguish it from both the typical architectural theory
    curriculum and the typical philosophical aesthetics courses. Without such a
    curriculum, students likely lack exposure to the philosophical approach to
    aesthetics that is dominant in American universities.

    <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The World Heritage Committee lists every year,
    several cultural sites as World Heritage properties. Some of these
    properties balance the notion of a landscape that bears combined works
    between nature and men, on which vernacular architecture is part of a local
    tradition of interaction with nature. The 3dPast research project is a
    European project, coordinated by Escola Superior Gallaecia and co-funded by
    the European Union, under the Creative Europe programme. The project studies
    and values vernacular knowledge of these unique places. In Portugal, the
    Pico landscape was listed as a World Heritage property due to the 500 years
    of history of local inhabitants adapting farming practices to produce wine,
    in a challenge environment and in a remote place in the middle of the
    Atlantic. This article aims to study, the history and the development of the
    island's architecture and urbanism, based on an ancestral way of life that
    is still alive nowadays. The scarcity of natural resources and the
    difficulties to travel between villages and islands emphasised the effects
    of insularity. However, the continuity of local culture, passed down through
    generations, created a strong identity, which is source of pride. The
    cultural landscape classified area includes about 987 hectares, from the
    parish of Criação Velha, on the south coast, to Santa Luzia, on the north
    side, covering part of two municipalities of Pico. The article first
    presents a brief historical background of the island. Following, it focuses
    on the evolution of human occupation, through the reading of population
    indicators and traditional architecture and urbanism, recognizing the unique
    cultural and landscape values within the property. Finally, it discusses the
    current regulatory framework on territorial planning, and the architectural
    and urban regulations in planning framework, with particular emphasis on
    processes and practices at different scales.</p>

    Architectural history books play a significant role in conveying the
    culture, norms, and values of the architectural discipline to newcomers. In
    recent years, numerous publications have spotlighted the importance of women
    and African Americans as critics, creators, and consumers of the built
    environment. Yet, to what extent is this recent discourse on gender and
    racial issues included in architectural history texts? And how gender or
    racially inclusive are they? Are twenty-first-century architectural
    educators presenting newly uncovered architectural histories from the
    nineteenth and twentieth centuries? Building upon prior research, this
    article seeks to address these issues by examining history texts currently
    assigned at fourteen leading architectural schools accredited by the
    National Architectural Accrediting Board. In textbooks with multiple
    editions, we compared relevant information in both earlier and later
    versions. Our analysis of these history texts revealed that contributions of
    women remain only marginally represented in the grand narrative of
    architecture. And for the most part, African Americans are omitted
    altogether. We challenge authors to reassess the next generation of
    architectural history texts and suggest ways to do so.

  abstract: >-
    Until quite recently, studying architectural history essentially meant
    learning the history of European urbanism and its extensions, from the
    eighteenth century onward, into North America. The architectural traditions
    of other parts of the world were left up to others—either to regional
    historians in the case of modernism or to area studies scholars in the case
    of “vernacular” structures built prior to industrialization. This geographic
    division of labor has changed dramatically in recent decades for a number of
    reasons, notably a growing awareness of, and opportunity to study in,
    far-flung parts of the world, along with a recognition of the profession's
    transatlantic biases and the pedagogical disadvantages that those
    limitations place on those teaching in classrooms populated by students
    whose careers will take them far beyond Europe and North America. In
    response, scholarly initiatives have emerged with the aim of writing a truly
    global architectural historical curriculum. Yet efforts to “globalize” the
    discipline have not been uncontroversial. Some detractors have detected a
    lack of rigor in the scholarship on “transnational flows”; others see a
    watering down of a robust existing canon, while still others critique an
    indisputable trendiness in researching the architecture of parts of the
    world that are currently of strategic political and economic importance,
    such as China and the Muslim world. These critics also perceive a thinly
    disguised historiographic agenda that seeks to understand the current round
    of globalization as the inevitable consequence of previous periods of
    cross-cultural encounter and exchange.So far, the results of these
    “globalizing” efforts have been mixed. While scholarship on non-Western
    architectural traditions is undoubtedly much better represented at
    architectural history conferences today than it was twenty years ago,
    several challenges remain. One is the reductive division into “Western” and
    “non-Western” topics, a binary taxonomy that defies both history and
    geography. Another problem is that scholars of certain parts of the
    world—such as Latin America and Southeast Asia—are very much aware of the
    disciplinary debates taking place in Europe, but the reverse is rarely true.
    Panels on, say, China or Africa are now commonplace at the annual meetings
    of the Society of Architectural Historians and the European Architectural
    History Network, but the interest of those who are not working in the
    particular regions discussed remains, to put it diplomatically, limited.In a
    nutshell, architectural historians today are confronted with two options.
    The first of these is to adhere to a Euro-American understanding of the
    discipline and ignore the cultural and thematic biases inherent in that
    severe geographic limitation. This option also entails the unstated
    expectation that our colleagues who work beyond the transatlantic sphere
    should continue to do double duty: familiarizing themselves with the
    foundations of both “Western” architecture and their home regions.
    Alternatively, we can endeavor to educate ourselves and our students about
    the broader global history of architecture and open ourselves up to a much
    wider range of themes that transcend a normative periodization that
    trifurcates architectural production into a history of European modernism,
    its antecedents, and its legacy. But wouldn't this larger purview, both
    temporal and spatial, come at the expense of a certain level of
    superficiality? After all, how can we possibly aspire to credible
    pedagogical expertise in the history of architecture of all cultures and
    time periods?Two recent books attempt to answer this pressing, and rather
    difficult, question: Kathleen James-Chakraborty's Architecture since 1400
    and A Critical History of Contemporary Architecture, 1960–2010, edited by
    Elie G. Haddad and David Rifkind. From the outset, James-Chakraborty readily
    confesses that it would be unwise to undertake a comprehensive spatial and
    stylistic study of six centuries of global architectural production and
    attempt to condense that into a single volume. Instead, she takes a thematic
    approach that foregrounds three main concerns: innovation, transfers, and
    connections. Thus the book “focuses on a relatively small number of
    examples, chosen to illustrate the range of ways that architects, builders,
    and their clients have built and occupied structures that … were in their
    day in the forefront of change” (xix). By investigating a discrete set of
    technical, aesthetic, and spatial innovations chosen from sites around the
    world, James-Chakraborty aims to decenter the existing literature on
    “global” architectural history that distinguishes between European and North
    American centers of innovation and production and non-Western sites of
    reception and implementation. Identifying instances of “indigenous
    modernization” from around the world, she advances a new model of global
    architectural history that rejects the idea that “western Europe, joined
    later by the United States, has consistently been in the forefront of new
    styles or construction technologies” and refuses to “privilege one continent
    over another as the locus of modernity or modernism, the aesthetic
    expression of modernity, at any particular time” (xviii). Instead, she
    frames the story of the past six centuries of architectural production in
    terms of transfers and connections, on the one hand charting an ongoing
    series of architectural exchanges that began to accelerate at the turn of
    the fifteenth century, as “new trading links affected the appearance of
    dwellings, workplaces, leisure environments, and houses of worship in cities
    around the world” (xviii), and on the other hand drawing thematic
    connections between unlikely case studies in order to highlight the
    recurrence of abiding themes across space and time. Some of these enduring
    questions are fundamental in nature: How do structures inscribe meaning into
    place? How can architecture serve as both a repository of history and
    cultural traditions and an agent of technical innovation and social
    progress? Others engage with the challenges posed by nature and technology,
    evident in James-Chakraborty's contemplation of the spatial and aesthetic
    constraints imposed by climate, topography, and geology, and in her analysis
    of the manifold ways in which changes in transportation, building materials,
    and engineering have continuously reshaped the practice of architecture.The
    book is at its strongest when James-Chakraborty explores these larger themes
    across space and time, teasing out critical precedents and influential
    figures in order to narrate a history of cross-cultural pollination. She
    explores how the Atomium in Brussels influenced the thinking of Japanese
    metabolists, for instance, and demonstrates how the renovation of the
    National Mall in Washington, D.C., shaped the conceptualization of the
    Rajpath in New Delhi. But she also departs from this standard mode of
    architectural narration by making more basic connections that transcend the
    technical and stylistic—for example, by drawing attention to parallels
    between the spatial organization of Chinese courtyard houses and the
    circular hut compounds typical of sub-Saharan Africa. The text flows nicely
    from chapter to chapter as this sequence of common themes—the convergence of
    the sacred and the profane in Lhasa's Potala Palace and the Residenz in
    Würzburg, say, or the varying approaches to housing the family unit in the
    wooden structures of Sumatra and Japan—gleefully toggles between continents
    and centuries.The dizzying array of cross-cultural references is
    complemented by James-Chakraborty's interrogation of architectural transfers
    both big and small, which she frames in terms of ongoing conversations about
    form, style, and spatial organization. She draws on iconic structures like
    the Süleymaniye in Istanbul and Bangkok's Wat Phra Kaew in order to
    illustrate a continuous dialogue between cultural influences—Ottoman and
    Italian in the case of the former, Chinese and Indian in the latter. In so
    doing, she highlights broader patterns of architectural syncretism
    throughout world regions like the Middle East and Southeast Asia. She
    likewise examines a judicious range of relevant social, environmental, and
    economic shifts that greatly influenced the production of architecture on a
    global scale, charting, for instance, how the influx of crops from the
    Americas to East Asia effected dramatic changes in the architectural
    composition of both Chinese cities and the surrounding countryside.An
    undertaking as ambitious as a study of six hundred years of global
    architectural history will inevitably need to be selective and abridged. It
    is therefore unhelpful to chide the author for what is missing (e.g.,
    Oceania) or entirely too brief (twelve pages for all of Africa!). The book's
    most abiding flaw lies in its rather unconvincing engagement with the
    architecture of everyday life, used by ordinary people. By and large, the
    book focuses primarily on structures that are iconic and exceptional,
    designed to inspire awe. In contrast, residential and administrative
    buildings are examined in great detail in Western cases but are, apart from
    a few meditations on vernacular Urhütten, largely missing elsewhere.
    Critical commercial typologies—such as the Ottoman han, the Southeast Asian
    shophouse, and the ports and central marketplaces that are the loci of urban
    life the world over—are likewise absent. The absence of these commercial
    buildings is curious, given that they physicalize the transnational circuits
    of trade that James-Chakraborty foregrounds in her methodological approach.
    Thus, although she voices criticism of our profession's tendency to focus on
    showcase architecture, particularly in the non-Western chapters the book
    evinces a lopsided fixation on the monumental, to the detriment of the
    quotidian. Moreover, while some subjects are discussed at great
    length—notably German modernism—other chapters feel a bit hurried, the
    inevitable result of trying to condense, for example, “Asian” architectural
    production, “from the Ottomans to the Qing, and from Korea to Sumatra,” into
    a few short pages (219). But these are quibbles, small in comparison to the
    overall achievements of the project.Too often, “global” histories of
    architecture are framed in terms of the implementation of Western aesthetic
    ideals in non-Western contexts, reducing the history of cross-cultural
    architectural exchanges to an interrogation of European and American
    architects’ expeditions into unfamiliar cultural and geographic terrains.
    Decentering that narrative is not a matter of political correctness, but
    rather represents an effort to write a more complete and complex
    architectural history of the world. James-Chakraborty's emphasis on thematic
    connections and cross-cultural dialogue provides an entry point for other
    scholars to draw attention to the many conduits of architectural knowledge
    and production that have entirely circumvented, and continue to circumvent,
    the transatlantic sphere.While its chronological scope is by comparison
    rather modest, Haddad and Rifkind's edited volume A Critical History of
    Contemporary Architecture, 1960–2010 is no less ambitious than
    James-Chakraborty's book in its effort to provide a comprehensive overview
    of the past half century of architectural production. The book begins by
    outlining the major themes in architectural history over the past half
    century, focusing primarily on the critiques of modernism; the counterpart
    rise of postmodern, deconstructionist, and postcolonial theory; and the
    growing concern with environmental sustainability. The second and much
    larger part of the book surveys architectural production across six
    continents (the architectural history of Antarctica remains to be written),
    with a heavy emphasis on Europe and Asia. In an attempt to “chart a middle
    course between ‘aesthetic’ histories that examine architecture solely in
    terms of its formal aspects and ‘ideological’ histories that subject it to a
    critique that often skirts the discussion of its material aspects” (4), the
    two editors have invited contributions by twenty-one additional authors who
    are experts in their respective regions. Individual essays are strong,
    including Laurent Stalder's explication of contemporary Swiss architecture
    as the encounter between Italian formality and Helvetic pragmatism. Kimberly
    Elman Zarecor succinctly synthesizes the complex postwar and post-Wall
    architectural history of the former Eastern bloc, teasing out themes that
    are central to the lived experience of socialism and postsocialism from the
    perspective of both the architect and the user. Tao Zhu's essay on
    architectural production in post-Mao China and Kelly Shannon's overview of
    tropical regionalism in Southeast Asia serve as efficient go-to resources
    for nonspecialists looking to familiarize themselves with the major themes,
    practices, and practitioners in world regions with which they may not be
    familiar. Ken Tadashi Oshima's chapter on post–World War II Japan offers a
    good analysis of, among other things, everyday dwelling and mass housing in
    a non-Western context (thereby filling in some of the gaps left by
    James-Chakraborty's book).Although these and other chapters are strong as
    stand-alone essays, the overall project suffers from a lack of
    organizational and thematic continuity. Standard features of most edited
    volumes, such as contributors’ notes and references that link the text to
    the images, are missing. Confusingly, the index alternates between
    categorizing architects by nationality and by the sites of their work, such
    that SANAA's Kazuyo Sejima is listed as a “Swiss” architect but not a
    Japanese one. Chinese designers are haphazardly alphabetized, some by given
    name and some by family name. The result is a volume that can be difficult
    to navigate.More problematic is the absence of the types of cross-references
    between cases and chapters that represent such a strength in
    James-Chakraborty's work. The book's geographic strictures lead to an
    unfortunate repetition of very basic themes, such as the polarizing impact
    of “Western” modernism in opposition to purportedly traditional styles.
    Here, cross-references would have been extremely helpful in contrasting, for
    example, Esra Akcan's excellent analysis of Istanbul and Dubai with Tao
    Zhu's discussion of Beijing and Shanghai. Similarly, the editors could have
    brought the physical implications of architects’ heightened ecological
    awareness to the fore by placing Oshima's meditations on technological
    disenchantment in 1970s Japan into dialogue with Phillip Tabb's essay on
    “greening architecture.”These missed opportunities attest to the conceptual
    pitfalls inherent in organizing a global history of architecture along
    geographic lines. In her chapter on architectural production in “West
    Asia”—which, apparently, encompasses Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Iraq, and the
    Gulf states—Akcan notes:In essence, Akcan critiques the underlying structure
    of the book, and in so doing echoes James-Chakraborty's emphasis on thematic
    connections and professional exchanges as the more appropriate
    epistemological framework for tracing the evolution of global architectural
    history.Finally, a major drawback of both books is the absence of maps and
    color photographs, both of which would have been rather well suited for
    illustrating the architectural transfers discussed in the text. These two
    volumes are best read in dialogue with each other, as the individual
    chapters in Haddad and Rifkind's book compensate for some of the geographic
    and typological lacunae in James-Chakraborty's work, which, in turn,
    provides a coherent underlying narrative that is sometimes lacking in the
    anthology. A forthcoming volume on critical approaches to contemporary
    architecture, edited by Swati Chattopadhyay and Jeremy White, promises to
    complete a handy trilogy of reference books that will be useful both for
    design schools keen on updating their history and theory curricula and for
    architectural historians eager to engage with the expanding geographic
    contours of our discipline.

    The Belgian architectural world of the 19th century has been considered a
    fascinating though little studied crossroads of influences. The same could
    be said of the architectural historiography of Belgium, which only
    established its independence from its powerful neighbours in 1830. Two of
    its canonical architectural historical publications, the Histoire de
    l’architecture en Belgique by A.G.B. Schayes (1808–59) and the Histoire de
    l’influence italienne sur l’architecture dans les Pays-Bas by Auguste Schoy
    (1838–85), represent two different ways of dealing with textual and visual
    material. This emerges from a precise analysis of context, authorial voice,
    use of sources and illustration media and relation to repertories of images
    such as private print collections. Typical of Schayes’s voice are the
    sparsely expressed personal appreciations and the many references to
    archives, literature and in situ observations, as if to prove every
    statement in word or image. Meanwhile, he rarely refers to his authoritative
    position as ‘national archéologue’ (as curator of the first national
    collection of antiquités), nor to his collection of prints and engravings.
    Schoy, on the contrary, does not shy from emitting personal opinions and
    boasting about his precious collection, his broad knowledge of rare
    manuscripts and collections and his in situ explorations of buildings. The
    fact that Schoy’s text did not make it into the accepted references in
    twentieth-century architectural histories in Belgium, whereas Schayes’s did,
    reveals much about how the discipline was formed and which methodological
    selections were made during its formative period.

    " The first global history of architecture to give equal attention to
    Western and non-Western structures and built landscapes, Architecture since
    1400 is unprecedented in its range, approach, and insight. From
    Tenochtitlan's Great Pyramid in Mexico City and the Duomo in Florence to
    Levittown's suburban tract housing and the Bird's Nest Stadium in Beijing,
    its coverage includes the world's most celebrated structures and spaces
    along with many examples of more humble vernacular buildings. Lavishly
    illustrated with more than 300 photographs, plans, and interiors, this book
    presents key moments and innovations in architectural modernity around the
    globe. Deftly integrating architectural and social history, Kathleen
    James-Chakraborty pays particular attention to the motivations of client and
    architect in the design and construction of environments both sacred and
    secular: palaces and places of worship as well as such characteristically
    modern structures as the skyscraper, the department store, and the cinema.
    She also focuses on the role of patrons and addresses to an unparalleled
    degree the impact of women in commissioning, creating, and inhabiting the
    built environment, with Gertrude Jekyll, Lina Bo Bardi, and Zaha Hadid
    taking their place beside Brunelleschi, Sinan, and Le Corbusier. Making
    clear that visionary architecture has never been the exclusive domain of the
    West and recognizing the diversity of those responsible for commissioning,
    designing, and constructing buildings, Architecture since 1400 provides a
    sweeping, cross-cultural history of the built environment over six
    centuries. "--

    This wide-ranging and beautifully produced collection of essays, edited by
    Gülru Necipoğlu and Alina Payne, addresses the role of ornament in
    architecture and the decorative arts in light of its recent revival in
    cutting-edge architecture and design. The publisher's description presents
    Histories of Ornament: From Global to Local as “the first major global
    history of ornament from the Middle Ages to today”; this is not a
    comprehensive survey, however, but an episodic study, composed of twenty-six
    individual contributions arranged thematically rather than chronologically.
    The result of a conference held at Harvard in 2012, it features many
    scholars with ties to that university. The coverage is impressively
    wide-ranging but by no means global. Almost all the essays address European,
    Asian, or North African material. Aside from Jonathan Hay's essay on a
    single Chinese vase, however, most of Asia, at least those parts of it lying
    east and south of India—not to mention Australia and sub-Saharan Africa—does
    not figure in a volume that is less a compendium than an assortment of
    highly focused, individual studies.

    Much has changed in our discipline in the last quarter century. In 1995,
    when the Society of Architectural Historians last held its annual conference
    in Seattle, a much higher proportion of its members had been trained and
    subsequently taught in art history departments than is the case today, when
    more have backgrounds in architecture and teach in schools of architecture.
    Another obvious shift can be seen in the locations of the architecture we
    study. Of the 183 papers originally scheduled to be presented at the SAH
    2020 conference in Seattle, roughly a quarter focused on the architecture of
    the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, Asia, and even Antarctica. That count
    does not include any of the papers that addressed the architecture of ethnic
    minorities both in Europe and in the English-speaking world, or that focused
    on the teaching of architectural history. Of the 111 papers listed in the
    program for the SAH 1995 conference, only 10 ranged beyond Europe and the
    English-speaking world, although, compared with contributions to the 2020
    conference, a higher percentage of the European papers in 1995 examined the
    architecture of Eastern Europe.1 There are multiple reasons for this major
    shift, but one was certainly already in evidence at the SAH 1995 conference,
    where the National Architectural Accrediting Board's recently introduced
    changes in requirements prompted much discussion.In 1995 the SAH Education
    Committee roundtable, chaired by Richard Cleary and Judith Hull, both then
    teaching at Carnegie Mellon, was described in the program as “initiat[ing]
    an effort to gather the perspectives of SAH members regarding the teaching
    of architectural history in schools of architecture. It will begin with a
    presentation of the NAAB review process that will suggest how SAH can
    contribute. In the discussion that follows, SAH members will be invited to
    consider the value of developing guidelines for schools of architecture to
    use in evaluating the architectural history components of their own
    professional degree programs.”2 The requirements resulting from this process
    included that students “be aware of/understand the diversity of
    architectural traditions and their histories throughout the world.”3This was
    the first time that schools of architecture in the United States and Canada
    had received a mandate to promote such inclusivity. The change was
    controversial. Even some SAH members at the forefront of pushing the
    boundaries of the canon resented the directive to restructure courses they
    had taught for decades. As an outspoken proponent of the change, I was
    subsequently invited to represent that position within SAH at a workshop
    held in November 1995 at the Heinz Architectural Center in Pittsburgh, an
    event also attended by representatives from the American Collegiate Schools
    of Architecture (ACSA), the NAAB, and the National Council of Architectural
    Accrediting Boards (NCARB).4 The issue surfaced again the following year,
    when the 1996 SAH conference in St. Louis included a presentation of the
    Education Committee's recommendations to the NAAB on the teaching of
    architectural history in schools of architecture. That year the roundtable
    focused on teaching the survey of architectural history. Curiously, the only
    geographic area to receive special attention in the conference program's
    session description was Eastern Europe, although “the search for a good
    introductory text” was also mentioned.5Despite these efforts to reform the
    curriculum, many schools of architecture evaded implementing the required
    changes. Yet other factors certainly contributed as well to the enlargement
    of the canon presented to architecture students. Concern for diversity was
    already an issue at the University of California, Berkeley, as early as
    1960, when student pressure induced Charles Moore to offer a course on the
    history of Asian architecture. Student influence also helped to prompt the
    hiring of Norma Evenson in 1963 (although Evenson later won the Alice Davis
    Hitchcock Book Award for her extremely influential book on Paris, she
    received the position at Berkeley based on her expertise regarding recent
    city planning in India, an area of concentration that she eventually
    extended to Brazil).6 In 1993 Stephen Tobriner met the challenge of
    expanding coverage of sub-Saharan Africa in the pre-1400 half of the
    Berkeley survey after students provided him with the names of sites, such as
    Meroë and Aksum, to place alongside Great Zimbabwe, already an established
    part of the Berkeley canon. Twenty-five years ago, many of those advocating
    for the global survey belonged to a generation influenced by the civil
    rights movement and advances in postcolonial discourse, such as Edward
    Said's 1978 publication of Orientalism.7 Furthermore, many of the art
    history departments where most scholars participating in these discussions
    had trained had long traditions of teaching the history of premodern
    architecture in both Latin America and Asia. By the 1980s the study of
    African and colonial architecture (with Suzanne Preston Blier and Renata
    Holod as respective pioneers in these fields) also began to enter their
    curricula.8Nonetheless, until the discussion of the NAAB requirements in the
    mid-1990s, historians of architecture based in American schools of
    architecture tended to focus more on expanding the discussion of European
    architectural and cultural theories than on deepening their knowledge of
    architecture from what is now termed the global South. Those who argued for
    the importance of the history of architecture in Africa, Asia, and Latin
    America were often perceived by their colleagues in architecture schools as
    coming from the periphery of the discipline. The sociologist Johannes
    Angermüller has argued that the rise of what is now called postmodern theory
    in American academia beginning in the mid-1970s, which had a significant
    impact on schools of architecture, also represented an effort to curtail the
    threats posed by affirmative action and feminism to the career possibilities
    of young white male academics.9 Certainly, in the 1990s the emphasis on
    theory in American architecture schools often served this purpose. Moreover,
    the 1995 NAAB guidelines appeared at a time when the effort to define
    architecture as an intellectual activity in order to enhance its academic
    status as a discipline also worked to push discussions of the vernacular out
    of many architecture schools. The contemporary establishment of new venues
    for the study of vernacular architecture, such as the Vernacular
    Architecture Forum in 1980 and the International Association for the Study
    of Traditional Settlements in 1988, further diminished the attention paid to
    these topics within SAH. The NAAB's 1995 push for an expanded canon thus
    represented a significant challenge to what was being taught in most
    American schools of architecture at the time.Although the NAAB-mandated
    changes empowered scholars who supported geographic inclusivity, the issue
    remained—and still remains today—a live wire at SAH meetings. At the 1998
    SAH conference, responding to requests made at a graduate student breakfast
    the year before, graduate students involved in teaching the introductory
    survey held the education roundtable as a closed session.10 Five years
    later, in 2003, Paula Lupkin and Zeynep Kezar chaired a session titled
    “Towards a World History of Architecture,” which was followed the next year
    by a roundtable they organized on the state of the architectural history
    survey. All four of that event's speakers—Dell Upton, Carol Krinsky, Christy
    Anderson, and Michael Lewis—taught in art history departments at the time.
    The roundtable featured sample course syllabi by Hilary Ballon, David
    Breiner, Richard Cleary, Alice Jarrard, Paula Lupkin, Anne Marshall, Lauren
    O'Connell, and myself.11 While all of these courses adhered to the new NAAB
    requirements, most faculty taught them in departments of art history rather
    than in architecture schools. In 2000, Zeynep Çelik became editor of the
    Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, and, not coincidentally,
    almost every issue of JSAH published since that time has included at least
    one article on the architecture of the global South. Eight of the eighteen
    SAH Founders’ Awards for the best article by a junior scholar granted
    between 2000 and 2019 went to this subset of work, with six of these awarded
    in the past nine years. Further important evidence for the changing
    understanding of the discipline in our professional society is that in eight
    of the past fifteen years, and six of the past twenty-one, SAH has granted
    the Spiro Kostof Book Award and the Alice Davis Hitchcock Book Award,
    respectively, to books on Latin American and Asian architecture.A new
    generation of textbooks represents another outgrowth of the changes
    initiated by the NAAB. In 1995 the best relatively new books on the market
    included Spiro Kostof's Architecture: Settings and Rituals, first published
    in 1985, and Marvin Trachtenberg and Isabelle Hyman's Architecture from
    Prehistory to Post-modernism: The Western Tradition, first published in
    1986.12 Kostof's book made the most significant effort to develop an
    inclusive approach, unless you count some editions of Banister Fletcher's
    handbook-like tome, although Fletcher never met with widespread success in
    the United States.13 Nonetheless, all of these publications clearly fell far
    short of the NAAB requirements.In 2003 McGraw Hill published the first
    comprehensive alternative to these texts, Marian Moffett, Michael Fazio, and
    Lawrence Wodehouse's Buildings across Time.14 Other publications soon
    followed: by the time McGraw Hill's representatives contacted me to
    encourage me to switch to this new offering, I had already been asked to
    review manuscript drafts of two more wide-ranging competitors. A Global
    History of Architecture, written by Francis D. K. Ching, Mark M. Jarzombek,
    and Vikramaditya Prakash, with the assistance of a team of MIT and
    University of Washington graduate students, crossed the line in 2006.15 As
    its title suggests, A Global History of Architecture provided a far more
    comprehensive survey than Buildings across Time, which did not originally
    include any architecture from sub-Saharan Africa. Richard Ingersoll's update
    of Kostof, titled World Architecture: A Cross-Cultural History (following a
    less comprehensive earlier revision by Greg Castillo), appeared in 2012.16
    Of course, simply covering the most celebrated monuments from around the
    world was not enough: all of these books largely ignored the roles of women
    in designing, commissioning, constructing, and using the buildings that they
    chronicled, and too many of the secular examples included were limited to
    the architectural patronage of what we now describe as “the 1 percent.” Such
    omissions began to be addressed in the survey that I published in 2014,
    Architecture since 1400, with examples ranging from Virginia slave cabins to
    South African townships as well as discussion of kitchens and settlement
    houses.17Political developments, and especially the aftermath of 9/11, also
    played a role in pushing historians of architecture who teach in
    NAAB-accredited programs in these new directions. Academics opposed to the
    invasion of Iraq by the United States and appalled by the damage the war
    caused to buildings and museums across the region turned with renewed
    interest to the study of Islamic, colonial, and postcolonial art and
    architecture.18 Increased familiarity with this material among those who are
    not specialists has also changed our understanding of the Western canon.
    Today experts on Gothic cathedrals often teach the Great Mosque of Córdoba,
    just as historians of the Italian Renaissance are well acquainted with the
    achievements of Sinan.19Global architectural surveys remain a challenge to
    teach, especially for those who have not studied at the universities where
    comprehensive training in the architecture of the global South has been on
    offer for decades. Few architecture schools have the resources to offer
    advanced classes in the history of the architecture of many regions around
    the world. Nonetheless, the commitment made by architectural historians to
    teach global surveys testifies to our scholarly community's dedication to
    the education of global citizens, and this dedication in turn has helped to
    transform our discipline.We have come far enough that we no longer depend on
    the NAAB to prod us into supporting the cross-cultural understanding that
    sustains free and open societies. Architectural historians based in
    countries beyond the NAAB's orbit now have also become leaders in this
    regard.20 But that does not mean that anyone will gain from a watering down
    of the requirement to teach the global history of architecture. In the late
    1980s and early 1990s, architecture schools saw an influx of historians with
    doctorates, a shift that did much to encourage an architectural research
    culture whose scope has more recently expanded to include a focus on
    sustainability.21 Undoubtedly, climate change poses a more significant
    challenge for the future of our students than does the cultivation of an
    ability to appreciate the architecture of the past. But learning how to
    reduce carbon footprints also depends at least in part on knowledge of and
    attention to that architecture.Twenty-five years ago, SAH represented a
    smaller, more ethnically homogeneous, and less well-traveled community of
    architectural historians than it does today. In the study of architectural
    history, students absorbed a canon that confirmed more often than challenged
    the dominant white masculinity of the architectural profession. The issues
    we face today, from the problem of holding annual conferences in the face of
    a pandemic to the threat of global extinction, are somewhat different. While
    we will continue to partner with the NAAB to ensure that we meet necessary
    accreditation requirements, ultimately it is up to us to explain the ways in
    which a better understanding of the history of the built environment
    enhances human experience.

    I outline the discursive logic of the two principal ways architectural
    theory has been conceived: historiographic critique and interdisciplinary
    historiography. Post-Renaissance theory-making fell into a pattern I call
    historiographic critique, which centered around the humanist imperative to
    link historical knowledge, social criticism, and architectural practice. In
    the 19th century, historiographic critique became increasingly incapable of
    creating viable conceptions of the past and was replaced by
    interdisciplinary historiography. The advantages and disadvantages of
    interdisciplinary historiography can already be seen in the work of Mies van
    der Rohe. He abolished narrow historicism in favor of consciously created
    dependencies between philosophy, history, and architectural theory drawn out
    over various times, cultures, languages, and academic disciplines.
    Unfortunately, the paradoxes inherent in the discursive logic of
    interdisciplinary historiography left it open to manipulations by
    intellectual formalists, in whose hands theory came to be treated as a
    discourse separate from its own historicity

    Over the last decades we have witnessed the increased intellectualization of
    architecture. What was first a largely autodidactic interest in Heidegger,
    Bachelard, and Joyce, is now the topic of textbooks, anthologies, seminar
    papers, with the committed student having to be familiar with the likes of
    Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, Barthes, Jameson, Gramsci, Derrida, Lacan, and now
    Deleuze. Though the architectural "take" on these philosophers is often
    inconsistent and spurious, the enterprise as a whole has to be understood
    within a system that is now almost a century old. Whether it was Le
    Corbusier's readings of Friedrich Nietzsche or Eric Mendelsohn's of Martin
    Buber, architects often turned to other disciplines, including psychology,
    Gestalt psychology in particular, to help position themselves within the
    intellectual determinants of modernity. The "history of theory" is thus more
    than just a specialized problem of the avant-garde. It is equivalent with
    the history of modernity. And yet, despite the importance of these exchanges
    (and despite theory's increasing self-academizations), it is still difficult
    for us to easily assess and historicize them.

  abstract: >-
    By returning to the theme of the presence in the world as the lynch pin of
    materialism, we may identify the conditions for the foundation of a strictly
    anti-naturalist materialism. This thematic eliminates a sterile
    confrontation of subject and object, and simultaneously lends support to the
    following two propositions : the world is chronologically first ; the
    subject is logically first. Materialism free of any naturalism thus opens
    the way to a political practice that goes beyond a simple logic of
    emancipation, in favor of a norm promising true liberation.

  abstract: >-
    An outline of the debate on the relationship between history and design that
    started in the 1960s prefaces a discussion about the contribution of history
    courses to the education of architecture students. A milestone of that
    debate was the rejection of the idea that the study of history can aid in
    the development of formal languages. Starting from that understanding of the
    boundary that exists between history and design, the article discusses the
    reasons that render the study of architectural history necessary.

  abstract: >-
    In eighteenth-century France, the influential architect and historian
    Julien-David Leroy studied ancient monuments through two different
    methods-what he called the "historical" and the "architectural." These two
    approaches had distinctly different intended audiences, methods, and goals.
    His historical method was a traditional humanistic approach to the ancient
    monuments that studied a building's architecture in relation to its specific
    historic context. His architectural method, consistent with scientific
    practice, considered the relations among numerous similar monuments as a
    means of revealing underlying universal laws. In the eighteenth century,
    history and science both promised enlightenment, but the exact shape of that
    new knowledge and its implications for the present varied tremendously.
    Through a comparative analysis of his two methods, and of their development,
    interaction, and significance, this paper assesses the exact shape of
    Leroy's dualistic thought, and its implications for architectural practice,
    history and theory.

  type: book

- id: kostof:1985history
  abstract: >-
    Ten years in the making, A History of Architecture ranges from the first
    prehistoric environments on record to the most recent examples of urban
    design. A landmark work of impressive scope, the book is enhanced by 700
    halftone illustrations and 150 drawings especially prepared by architect
    Richard Tobias. Kostof's range of study includes not only the monumental
    religious, governmental and upper-class structures around which
    architectural history has usually been written but also the diversity of
    ordinary domestic, rural, and urban buildings, and landscapes which surround
    them. Moreover, Kostof evaluates Western achievement in the context of
    contemporary cultures elsewhere. Thus he discusses the high points of
    imperial Rome along with Buddhist stupas and Han palaces, compares medieval
    Florence with medieval Cairo, and introduces Inca and Aztec cities as the
    Spanish conquistadores would have seen them. The author's premise is that
    buldings are conditioned by the social, economic, and political frame of
    their time; in this sense, Kostof concludes, the history of architecture can
    be considered an aspect of the history of human institutions. "Architecture,
    in the end," he writes, "is nothing less than the gift of making places for
    some human purpose."

  abstract: >-
    A theory of ‘cultural sustainability’ in architecture must be underpinned by
    a conceptualization of architecture that is sensitive to cross-cultural
    contexts and values and not overly dominated by Western concepts of what
    architecture is. A number of key areas are thus outlined for design
    consideration if cultural sustainability is to become more intimately
    aligned with architectural outcomes. These include the cross-cultural
    variation in where authority lies in building and design decisions,
    culturally specific forms of spatial behaviour and the meanings encoded into
    buildings and environments. The cultural properties of buildings need to be
    positioned as a subset of the cultural properties of places, and the
    dynamics of architectural traditions and their time properties need to be
    understood within varying scales of cultural change processes. Finally
    consideration is provided to cultural constructs of well-being and social
    design in the environment.

- id: momigliano:1990classical
  abstract: "Here, at last, are the long-awaited Sather Classical Lectures of the great historian Arnaldo Momigliano, In a masterly survey of the origins of ancient historiography, Momigliano captures those features of an ancient historian's work that not only gave it importance in its own day but also encouraged imitation and exploitation in later centuries. He reveals the extent to which Greek, Persian, and Jewish historians influenced the Western historiographic tradition, and then goes on to examine the first Roman historians and the emergence of national history. In the course of his exposition, he traces the development of antiquarian studies as distinctive branch of historical research from antiquity to the modern period, discusses the place of Tacitus in historical thought, and explores the way in which ecclesiastical historiography has developed a tradition of its own. All these lectures illustrate Momigliano's unrivaled ability to combine the study of classical texts and the history of classical scholarship.\_First delivered in 1962, the lectures were revised during the next fifteen years and then held for annotation that was never completed. They are now published from the author's manuscripts, collated and checked by Momigliano's literary executor, Anne Marie Meyer, of the Warburg Institute, with a foreword by Riccardo Di Donato, of the University of Pisa. The text is printed as the author left it.\_Sather Classical Lectures, 54"

  abstract: >-
    Some anthropologists have suggested prehistoric Old and New world contacts.
    Meggers, Evans, and Estrada are the most recent advocates, and their
    hypothesis of a landfall by Japanese fishermen on the coast of Ecuador seems
    to have been the causa belli of the attack by John Rowe on "doctrinaire
    diffusionism." In a response to Rowe, Jett and Carter (1966) suggest his
    level of absolute proof is the best, but not the only, proof. Rowe's
    absolute proof is best because it can be rigorously and objectively tested.
    But if this level of proof is not met, then the acceptance of such evidence
    becomes an "act of faith." The hypotheses of transoceanic contacts can not
    be evaluated adequately for or against until this level of proof is
    achieved. Until such time, the acceptance of such theories will remain "acts
    of faith."

    The issues surrounding the function and meaning of vernacular architecture
    in the twenty-first century are complex and extensive. Taking a
    distinctively rigorous theoretical approach, this book considers these
    issues from a number of perspectives, broadening current debate to a wider
    multidisciplinary audience. These collected essays from the leading experts
    in the field focus on theory, education and practice in this essential
    sector of architecture, and help to formulate solutions to the
    environmental, disaster management and housing challenges facing the global
    community today.

    Part of the fallout from the Modern Movement is our perception of our time,
    ourselves, as somehow set apart from history. Our apparently
    anti-historicist heritage, and the perceived failure of its utopia, has cast
    in doubt our relationship with the past and our ability to produce a
    meaningful present and future. In the realms of criticism and design, there
    seems to be an artificial distinction between "then" and "now," leaving us
    in a distended present. Our concern is the meeting point of history and
    design in the activities of operative criticism. Operative criticism,
    described by Manfredo Tafuri in Theories and History of Architecture,
    assumes a subjective reading of history, distorting the past to re-make it
    for the present. Operative criticism accepts the inevitable fact that the
    present always conditions the perceptions of the past.

    This paper is concerned with the practical problem of shaping a "History of

    the complex and difficult realities of articulating difference. Through a
    critical analysis of Spiro Kostof's "A History of Architecture" and an
    exposition of the shortcomings of Kostof's attempts to discuss "alternative"
    histories, this paper investigates how architectural history textbooks could
    play an important role in initiating a broader, critical teaching of

  abstract: >-
    It is difficult to overstate the tremendous impact of Edward Said's
    Orientalism on the various fields of the humanities in Western academia.1
    Said's wide-ranging, profound, and multidisciplinary critique of the ways in
    which the triumphant culture of our times, the Western one from the
    Enlightenment to the present, has encountered, codified, and represented the
    culture of its most immediate other, the Islamic Orient, opened the door for
    all repressed cultures to question their received representation and to
    deconstruct the discourse that produced it over time.2 This has led to the
    revolution in the humanities that we identify today as postcolonial
    criticism, a revolution that was a long time coming, but Orientalism, and
    the charismatic personality of its author, provided the catalyst around
    which its diverse strands finally coalesced.3Even today, forty years after
    the book's publication, and despite sustained denunciation from detractors
    on the right and left alike, Said's fundamental critique of the political
    and ideological frames of knowledge in general, and knowledge about Islam in
    particular, still reverberates across academia worldwide. Entire domains of
    inquiry into the cultural production of both the colonizing and colonized
    worlds, as well as all marginalized minority groups and their sometimes
    amiable but mostly confrontational interaction, have found their ways into
    curricula and university programs in the West and in the postcolonial
    world.4 They have all benefited from the trail blazed by Said's Orientalism
    and his subsequent elaborations on the intersection between empire (as both
    locus of power and representation) and culture and the role of intellectuals
    in our extremely divided yet thoroughly interconnected world.5 In fact, as
    Anne Wagner, the prominent historian of nineteenth-century art, told me
    thirty years ago, scholars in the humanities cannot avoid the “post-Saidian”
    epistemological milieu in which they have to labor regardless of their
    specific fields of study or their views of Said's criticism.Architectural
    history—and architectural practice to a lesser extent—has felt the impact of
    Said's Orientalism as well, even though Said himself, a relentless literary
    and political critic who was also an accomplished pianist and a classical
    music and opera reviewer, had very little to say about architecture.
    Occasionally, he would mention a particular building in passing as a
    backdrop to his narrative in one of the essays or journalistic reviews that
    he regularly published in the Egyptian Al-Ahram Weekly newspaper. But he
    otherwise never turned his sharp eyes and scathing wit directly to
    architecture, even though he was aware and appreciative of art and
    architectural criticism. He did, however, engage in extended debates over
    theoretical and historiographical issues that pertained to art and
    architecture, as I witnessed in 1985 when a group of graduate students of
    which I was a part organized a conference at MIT on the postmodern condition
    and invited Said and Fredric Jameson, along with several leading art and
    architectural theorists and critics, for two days of exhilarating
    intellectual one-upmanship.Unsurprisingly, the clearest influence that
    Said's Orientalism has had within architectural history is on the so-called
    non-Western subfields (a category that reeks of imperialist superiority),
    especially the study of Islamic architecture and modern architecture outside
    the West.6 But it has also affected the study of global architecture, a
    label and an approach that owe much to the rigorous criticism and expansive
    perspective that Said and other like-minded historians and critics enabled.7
    Before Said, architectural history subscribed too uncritically to the
    canonical view of architecture as a culturally stratified domain, with the
    architecture of the West, from its presumed classical origins to its
    glorious culmination in modern times, constituting the historical core of
    the field, while other architectural traditions, if acknowledged at all,
    were relegated to marginal places in its ordered hierarchy.8 This was best
    exemplified by the famous “Tree of Architecture” of the two Banister
    Fletchers (father and son), which appeared as frontispiece in all seventeen
    editions of their influential book A History of Architecture on the
    Comparative Method for the Student, Craftsman, and Amateur, published
    between 1896 and 1954. This unabashed yet fanciful Eurocentric diagram
    reserved the living trunk and the upper, healthy branches of the tree to an
    uninterrupted succession of Western styles from ancient Greece to modern
    America (dubbed historical styles) and demoted the architecture of all other
    cultures (labeled nonhistorical styles) to dead-end branches functioning
    primarily as stylistic curiosities.9Things slowly began to change in 1985
    with the publication of Spiro Kostof's A History of Architecture, one of the
    earliest works to respond to Said's criticism, albeit indirectly and without
    ever mentioning Orientalism.10 The influence, moreover, is apparent in the
    structure of the book rather than in its narrative or arguments, which
    remained wedded to the center/periphery model of analysis. Kostof not only
    included periods and examples of non-Western architectural traditions, a
    practice going back to James Fergusson and Banister Fletcher, but also, for
    the first time in an English-language architectural survey, presented a
    select few of these in comparative pairings with their chronological
    equivalents in the Western historical sequence. He did this exclusively
    between the two sides of the Mediterranean: the Christian and the Islamic,
    with Cairo and Florence paired together in the late Middle Ages and Istanbul
    and Venice in the Renaissance.11 But as architectural historian Panayiota
    Pyla has noted, Kostof's pairings were neither historically nor culturally
    symmetrical. In both examples, he could not shed his reliance on Western
    architecture as the “yardstick” against which the architecture of the
    Islamic other is measured, nor could he contextualize the Islamic examples
    in their own settings (his favorite phenomenological term) as he so
    impeccably did for the Western ones.12The centrality of Western architecture
    in Kostof's understanding of architectural history was even more pronounced
    in his short sections on those architectural traditions—such as those of
    India, China, and Nepal—that did not interact with the West before the
    colonial period. There, his review differed little from his predecessors’
    except in the important distinction of his using a phenomenological language
    that overtly romanticized and somewhat dehistoricized architecture, as
    opposed to the formalist and stylistic language of his precursors, which was
    used to enforce a hierarchical structure of architectural traditions.13
    Thus, it is possible that Kostof's atypical treatment of Islamic
    architecture as the privileged counterpart to premodern Western architecture
    was not the result of a conscious critical rethinking of architectural
    history's biased formation. It may in fact have been related to his
    familiarity with the Ottoman tradition owing to his having been raised in
    Istanbul. But it also could have been a subconscious reaction to Said's
    pointed criticism of the West's long-held derogatory attitudes toward
    anything Islamic, of which Kostof must have been aware and which had been
    intensifying in the time in which he and Said were writing—as they are again
    today.The methodological corrective in surveying global architecture
    guardedly explored by Kostof went through several stages of inconclusive
    refinement in the subsequent three decades, with new editions and revisions
    of the standard surveys in the field as well as new surveys of what began to
    be named “world architecture.” Thus, for instance, Fletcher's seventeenth
    edition of 1961 had replaced the binary division of historical and
    nonhistorical styles of earlier editions with another dyad that, although
    less overtly offensive, still endowed only Western architecture with
    historical evolution (“Ancient Architecture and Western Succession”) while
    gathering all non-Western traditions under the über-geographical and loaded
    label “East,” regardless of their actual location on the world map vis-à-vis
    Europe.14 The nineteenth edition of 1987 (notice the date), however, finally
    softened the hard-edged dual opposition by breaking the content into seven
    sections, arranged chronologically, mixing geographic pairing (Europe and
    the Mediterranean to the Renaissance, Islam, and early Russia) with
    chronological periodization (colonial and postcolonial periods outside
    Europe, twentieth century) in a clear attempt to transcend the exclusionary
    Western succession of earlier editions and to historicize other hitherto
    neglected traditions.15The twentieth, or centennial, edition of 1996, edited
    by the noted architectural historian and commentator Dan Cruickshank, with
    almost twenty consultant editors and contributors, further revamped the
    structure and tone of the book in ways that hinted at a direct reaction to
    the kind of criticism initiated by Said's Orientalism, although that book
    remained unacknowledged in the bibliography.16 This was most evident in a
    new section of six chapters covering the architecture of Islam from its
    pre-Islamic roots in Hellenistic and Persian architecture through the
    Gunpowder Empires of the Mughals, Safavids, and Ottomans. The last chapter
    in this section, however, strangely reverted to two idiomatic conceptions
    about Islamic architecture: the one resurrecting the quality of
    timelessness, focusing on vernacular architecture; the other imbued with
    fantasy and otherworldliness as it projects Islamic garden traditions
    through the prism of a paradisiacal vision that is supposed to have animated
    all garden design over fourteen centuries in diverse ecologies from the
    desert to the rain forest.17 These two tropes had long been espoused by many
    Orientalist historians as essential components of the canned definition of
    Islamic architecture as both artisanally oriented and spiritually
    motivated.18 The reiteration of these notions in this section ignored the
    many recent critical works on both subjects that challenged their validity
    or representativeness and questioned the motivations of those who insisted
    on using them. It also unveiled the residual stratum in some of the new
    writing in this authoritative book, one unable to disentangle itself from
    the Eurocentric roots of its dichotomous structure and its concomitant
    differential projections of historical versus changeless styles.A break from
    the historical, even chronological, Eurocentrism of the survey mode was
    needed if the field was to become truly global. This kind of approach was
    finally undertaken by Francis Ching, Mark Jarzombek, and Vikramaditya
    Prakash in their A Global History of Architecture (first edition 2006 and
    now in its third edition).19 As the insertion of the refurbished term global
    in the title implies, the book tries to transcend the Western bias of
    earlier world architectural surveys by using an inclusive global
    perspective. This is buttressed by a neutral chronological periodization and
    a vast time span to tell the history of world architecture from as far back
    as archaeological records allow. The authors clearly seek to avoid the
    shortcomings of their predecessors, devising a new approach that treats all
    architectural traditions equally by framing them in a comparative
    chronological structure that depends solely on numerical time frames. And
    notwithstanding the huge imbalance inherent in the quality and quantity of
    architectural data available for the various cultures and time frames
    covered, the authors try hard to treat all places and periods with the same
    level of analysis without constantly referring to a model or a core index in
    the form of Western architectural succession.20Here too, however, we can
    surmise the influence of Said's critique, which may have been due more to
    the authors’ general agreement with the postcolonial understanding of
    historiography than to their conscious reading of his books. They do not
    mention Said or his work, or even the term Orientalism, at all in their
    text, but their dismissal of the usual European cultural frame of reference
    and their total dependence on a chronological one betray a tacit recognition
    of the inevitable pitfalls of any culturally self-centered perspective in
    the study of other cultures. Posthumously, Said's criticism of Eurocentric
    nonchalance has been vindicated, even if only tacitly and without direct
    reference. Leveling the playing field in assessing the architectural
    achievements of all historical cultures, however, seems to have been the
    authors’ goal for A Global History of Architecture, a goal that has been
    reinforced by Jarzombek's pursuit of the deepest, and implicitly most
    common, roots of human acts of building in his Architecture of First
    Societies: A Global Perspective (2013), the sequel to his jointly authored
    global history book.21If Said's influence is at best hidden or implied in
    global architectural surveys published after the intellectual splash that
    Orientalism caused, it is more explicit, sometimes begrudgingly so, in
    recent studies of Islamic architecture.22 Translated into the major Islamic
    languages shortly after its initial publication in English, Said's book
    quickly became a best seller of sorts, providing students of Islamic
    cultural production with the critical lever they had long needed in their
    painful, and often unsuccessful, efforts to be admitted into their specific
    humanities fields as full participants rather than as area studies
    specialists. Historians of Islamic architecture faced the same challenge.23
    Their own domain had been seen at best as a self-contained area of study
    that was religiously and culturally essentialist or environmentally
    deterministic, and at worst as derivative, passé, ornamentalist,
    ahistorical, and lacking in tectonic rationality.24 These dismissive notions
    reflected the enduring influence of two manifestly interdependent scholarly
    traditions: authoritative Eurocentric art and architectural historiography
    on one hand, and on the other, the study of Islam in the West that we came
    to call “Orientalism,” with its various peregrinations in the nineteenth and
    twentieth centuries. Such negative views were not applied only to Islamic
    art and architecture. Until at least the 1970s, the same kind of disdainful
    attitudes framed the scope and methods of the study of all non-Western
    artistic and architectural subdisciplines and assigned them their prescribed
    slots in the chronologically, geographically, and ideologically historical
    and artistic Eurocentric hierarchy.25Said insisted on the discursive
    heritage of representation of all things Islamic, a heritage that was
    enthralled with and in the service of imperialism during the colonial
    period, which ranged variably between the sixteenth and the twentieth
    centuries. Indeed, the first students of Islamic architecture were all
    Europeans who, from as early as the 1820s, traveled to the “Orient” in the
    wake of the first European military interventions in search of adventure,
    employment, and the thrill of fantasy associated with those mysterious
    lands. Like other Orientalists in various fields of inquiry, they became
    engaged in a vast enterprise of collecting, processing, and interpreting
    bits of information on all aspects of history, culture, and society in the
    “Orient.” They visited “Oriental” cities and sites—primarily in Spain,
    western Turkey, the Holy Land, Egypt, and India—where they measured and
    recorded buildings and ruins and illustrated them. They then produced
    impressive catalogues of singular monuments, series of buildings, and
    architectural and ornamental details that introduced to Europe a rich
    Islamic architectural heritage that was previously almost totally
    unknown.26These trailblazers were followed by several generations of
    architects, draftsmen, and archaeologists who expanded the scope of this
    surveying and classification in time and space. The architects and draftsmen
    went after the little-known monuments in hitherto unexplored regions that
    were slowly opening up to Western influence and dominance. They covered
    Anatolia, Persia, India, Morocco, and Arabia, and eventually penetrated the
    faraway reaches of the Islamic world in places such as Central Asia and
    sub-Saharan Africa.27 By the middle of the twentieth century, the terrain
    had been mostly mapped out. With the nagging exception of Southeast Asia,
    most major buildings in the Islamic world had been measured, recorded, and
    classified into types and styles following a rather rigid dynastic
    periodization that is still more or less with us today.Despite their erudite
    and prodigious output, these Western students of Islamic architecture were
    neither equipped to convey nor interested in communicating the substantial
    intracultural variety and purposeful continuity within Islamic architecture
    or its conscious intercultural interactions, past and present.28 Instead,
    they set the stage for a self-contained architectural discourse, charting
    the history of Islamic architecture as an endogenous and seemingly insular
    tradition that began with the building of the Mosque of the Prophet in
    Medina around 620 CE and inexplicably fizzled out with the dawn of the
    colonial age.29 Their end dates varied between the Taj Mahal in Agra, India
    (1632–48) and the Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmet Mosque) in Istanbul (1609–16)
    (Figures 1 and 2). But these historians never crossed into the nineteenth
    and twentieth centuries. That is, their history avoided confronting the
    problem of Islamic architecture's encounter with modernity and its
    theoretical and historiographic implications.The practice of disciplinary
    cultural demarcation, which depended more on ideological postures than on
    historical facts or scholarly reflections, survived far longer than did its
    biased and compromised source, the bluntly Eurocentric civilizational
    stratification of the triumphant colonial age.30 It promoted, and even
    demanded, comprehensive studies of architecture confined within clearly
    proscribed and exclusive time, space, and culture. It even affected the
    writing of many postindependence architectural historians in the sometimes
    incongruously formed nations of the colonized world. In their zeal to purge
    their emerging national identities from any potentially damning colonial or
    foreign influence, these scholars adopted the culturally separate line of
    development that the model promulgated, so as to reconstruct a “pure” and
    “authentic” cultural and architectural heritage.31 As succinctly noted by
    Frantz Fanon many years ago, and rearticulated by Edward Said in Orientalism
    and his later Culture and Imperialism (1993), the nationalists’ heartfelt
    resistance to a hegemonic intellectual construct did not prevent them from
    falling into the trap of its conceptual and interpretive biases. They ended
    up constructing and categorizing the history of “their” architecture, and of
    “their” culture in general, from an exclusive and ultimately narrowly
    defined national, religious, or cultural perspective.32 The examples of this
    inclination are numerous, but the most glaring and unmistakably affected
    histories can be seen in the various surveys of Central Asian architecture
    written during the Soviet period, which emphasized ethnic particularity over
    cultural identity, and in the studies of Iranian and Turkish architecture
    produced until very recently in Iran and Turkey, which sought in the distant
    past cultural roots that defined each nation independent of its extensive
    Islamic identity.33The study of Islamic architecture underwent a certain
    renaissance in the past few decades, owing in no small measure to the “Said
    effect.” This coincided with and provided intellectual prestige and
    rhetorical ammunition to two instrumental and ultimately interrelated
    phenomena, one architectural and the other, unsurprisingly, financial. The
    first was the onset of the age of postmodernism in architecture in the 1970s
    and 1980s, with its renewed if lighthearted approach to history as
    inspiration and its not-so-masked stress on identity politics as a formally
    expressive architectural tool.34 Both orientations resonated with the
    mounting pressure in the Islamic world for culturally and historically
    inspired architecture, a direction that started to express itself around the
    same time and for reasons that stemmed primarily from disappointment with
    the often half-baked, top-down, and ultimately miscarried modernist
    experiments conducted throughout the 1950s and 1960s in the newly
    independent countries.35 Thus, the 1980s became the decade of readily
    identifiable, Islamicized postmodern architecture that fulfilled a real
    hunger for cultural (and religious, which would eventually supplant the
    cultural with the rise of Islamism) self-expression.36 There were the
    posttraditionalists who, like the celebrated Egyptian visionary architect
    Hassan Fathy (1900–1989) before them, looked for inspiration in vernacular
    architecture (Figure 3).37 There were also the free, and often arbitrary,
    mélanges of diverse historical forms and patterns from a wide range of
    Islamic styles, which borrowed from postmodern architecture its idioms and
    validation (Figure 4).38 This trend culminated in grand structures by large
    international firms, which reinterpreted visual symbols and historical
    motifs and used them mostly as surface articulation or footprint patterns in
    otherwise ultrasleek, contemporary designs.39 A small publishing industry
    thrived on the growing demand for easily accessible, nonscholarly primers on
    Islamic architecture, producing numerous books on Islamic typologies,
    patterns, and monumental landmarks, several of which were reissues of famous
    nineteenth-century European graphic compendia.40The second phenomenon to
    propel the new interest in Islamic architecture was the forceful entry of
    new, mostly Arab Islamic wealth into the international scene following the
    sharp rise in oil prices in the mid-1970s. Premier Western cultural
    institutions, already experienced in cultivating patronage, managed to
    become the privileged recipients of generous sponsorship from wealthy Muslim
    rulers and business tycoons, who were becoming increasingly eager to counter
    the Western heritage of negativity toward Islam by presenting a civilized
    and artistically sophisticated image of Islamic cultures in academia,
    museums, and media. As a consequence, Islamic art collections were expanded
    and housed in newly designed sections in top Western museums, even as new
    museums for Islamic art opened in the Islamic world.41 New academic chairs
    for the study of Islamic art and architecture were endowed in the 1980s and
    1990s at several top-tier American and European universities, almost
    quadrupling the number of positions devoted to the field. And although this
    drive started slightly before Said's Orientalism was published, the ideas
    and language that his book conveyed soon permeated not only the narratives
    developed around the revived interest in Islamic art and architecture but
    also the critical stance that a new generation of postcolonial scholars took
    against the perceived opportunism, naïveté, and even hypocrisy of that same
    drive.The first effort to package Islam as a rich culture and
    artistic/architectural tradition was the World of Islam Festival, an
    unprecedented megacultural event whose origins date to 1973. This event
    aimed to do no less than “present one civilization—in all its depth and
    variety—to another.”42 A trust that gathered governments and leading British
    and international educational and cultural institutions sponsored the
    festival, which opened in 1976 and included exhibitions, lectures, symposia,
    books, films, and musical and theatrical performances. One of the
    exhibitions at the Hayward Gallery in London creatively displayed the
    “architecture of Islam” by projecting images of hundreds of buildings and
    their details in a specially constructed cube-shaped theater. This
    architecture was further explored in several festival-related publications
    produced over the next decade that covered subjects ranging from the
    “Islamic city” to the minutest details of architectural decoration.43 Mixing
    the inherited romanticism of the Orientalist tradition with new and
    wide-ranging sympathetic scholarship, the World of Islam Festival's
    publications represented a middle ground between the colonial scholarship of
    curiosity and acquisition, tinged with the sense of superiority of
    yesteryear, and the veritable revolution in thinking that came after Said's
    Orientalism, even if that work's influence remained unacknowledged in
    several cases.A parallel development to the World of Islam Festival was the
    founding of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1977, followed almost
    immediately by the establishment of the Aga Khan Program for Islamic
    Architecture (AKPIA) at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology in 1978. Operating independently of one another but having
    similar aspirations, the two programs had a direct impact on the
    appreciation and study of Islamic architecture. Through an elaborate process
    of selection, evaluation, and publication of hundreds of nominated projects
    from around the Islamic world and beyond over the past forty years, the Aga
    Khan Award has succeeded in turning a relatively neglected domain of
    practice into an unavoidably acknowledged contributor to the maturity and
    diversity of contemporary architecture. Coming on the scene both at the tail
    end of the postmodern moment and at the time of an intensifying turn toward
    Islamism, the award initially focused on historical continuity, vernacular
    revival, and critical regionalism.44 Over time, however, its direction has
    been adjusted to respond to mounting environmental, social, and global
    challenges to architecture and development. Incorporating various
    technologically and environmentally driven, adaptive reuse, and conservation
    concerns within its core historicist and regionalist criteria, the Aga Khan
    Award has enlarged its purview in a rather conciliatory manner to encompass
    contemporary design, social housing, community improvement, historic
    preservation, and landscape design.The Aga Khan Program for Islamic
    Architecture, on the other hand, is an academic initiative dedicated to
    teaching and researching Islamic art and architecture, urbanism, landscape,
    and conservation. Given the program's mission of promoting and increasing
    the teaching of Islamic architecture, the decision to locate AKPIA in the
    architecture departments of two of the most prestigious institutions of
    architectural education in the world was a novel and intellectually
    challenging one.45 The program's implicit aim was to bridge the pedagogical
    gap between the discipline of architecture and Islamic architecture, which
    was a clear manifestation of the binary structure of architectural knowledge
    rooted in the legacy of Orientalism.46That Edward Said's Orientalism still
    figures heavily in the academic offerings at AKPIA and other graduate
    programs devoted to the study of Islamic art and architecture is not only a
    manifestation of the book's enduring intellectual relevance and critical
    rigor. Alas, it is also a sign of the canonical rigidity and cultural
    complicity of architectural history's dominant discourse, which still treats
    architectural experiences outside its own traditional geopolitical and
    historical domain with suspicion or contempt, especially when these other
    experiences are motivated by a sense of resistance to that same discourse
    and its exclusivity.47 For their part, Islamic architectural scholars of the
    last two generations have rejected the notions of uniformity, introversion,
    and cultural and religious determinism that long dominated their field and
    have extended their domain of inquiry into hitherto neglected periods,
    areas, and points of contact with other cultures.48 The cumulative effect of
    these inquiries has been to set Islamic architecture well on its way to
    finally devising its own historical and methodological contours, which, when
    academic Orientalism is truly overcome, will undoubtedly enrich the broader
    field of architectural history and finally bring Islamic architecture into
    its fold.49

    Doctrinaire diffusionism is a menace to the development of sound
    archaeological theory based on comparative studies; it distracts
    archaeologists from such studies and seeks to destroy the basis of
    comparison. Diffusionist arguments are defective in principle, however. The
    bias in the selection of data for these arguments can be illustrated by
    listing cultural similarities between ancient Peru and the ancient
    Mediterranean.

    This article presents the first results of an ongoing investigation of the
    Temple of Hera at Olympia. Because it is traditionally believed that the
    temple was designed with wooden columns that were only later replaced by the
    stone columns now in situ, the Heraion has been widely cited as a key
    example for the tectonic theory of the origins of Doric architecture.
    However, a review of the archaeological evidence at Olympia and comparable
    sites, the testimony of Pausanias, and the findings from recent fieldwork
    demonstrate that the Heraion’s peristyle was very likely stone from the
    beginning. This challenge to the traditional understanding of the
    construction history of the Heraion has broad ramifications for our
    understanding of early Doric architecture.

    "This volume is the first text to focus specifically on the archaeology of
    domestic architecture. Covering major theoretical and methodological
    developments over recent decades in areas like social institutions,
    settlement types, gender, status, and power, this book addresses the
    developing understanding of where and how people in the past created and
    used domestic space. It will be a useful synthesis for scholars and an ideal
    text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in archaeology and
    architecture. The book: covers the relationship of architectural decisions
    of ancient peoples with our understanding of social and cultural
    institutions; includes cases from every continent and all time periods--from
    the Paleolithic of Europe to present-day African villages; is ideal for the
    growing number of courses on household archaeology, social archaeology, and
    historical and vernacular architecture"--

  abstract: >-
    " De quoi n'a-t-on pas écrit l'histoire ? Il en reste une cependant qui est
    encore à faire, et qui ne serait pas la moins intéressante. Je parle de
    l'histoire des histoires " (César Daly, 1849). Si, depuis les années 1970,
    de nombreux auteurs se sont penchés sur l'historiographie politique,
    artistique ou scientifique, l'histoire de l'histoire de l'architecture a
    fait l'objet de peu d'études. Les raisons en sont multiples :
    l'éparpillement des sources, la crise de l'architecture elle-même, les
    clivages qui peuvent exister entre architectes et historiens de l'art. Sans
    doute la " muséalisation " de l'architecture, la définition du patrimoine et
    la pédagogie, sont aujourd'hui des questions incontournables. Examiner les
    origines de l'historiographie de l'architecture - qui a connu récemment une
    émergence remarquable - est une priorité pour nourrir ce débat. La matière
    est riche. Depuis les publications des antiquaires du XVIIIe siècle, la
    connaissance des monuments ne cesse de progresser. L'exemple des
    naturalistes, des grands fondateurs de l'histoire politique et des
    archéologues suscitent la volonté de concevoir une autre histoire de
    l'architecture, plus scientifique. En France, les années 1863 à 1914
    s'avèrent une véritable période charnière caractérisée par d'innombrables
    histoires, essais, études globales et partielles, par une évolution continue
    des moyens de représentation de l'architecture, par la multiplication des
    établissements d'enseignement et des approches pédagogiques. Parmi les
    grands acteurs de cette période figurent Viollet-le-Duc, Ramée, Dartein,
    Baudot, ou Ruprich-Robert. A l'issue de leurs travaux analysés ici
    méthodiquement dans leur contexte, le visage de l'histoire de l'architecture
    est entièrement transformé. Elle a trouvé sa propre définition, elle a
    affiné ses moyens de représentation et dispose désormais d'outils
    méthodologiques efficaces.

    S'il existe, depuis l'Antiquité, de très nombreux écrits sur l'histoire de
    l'art, son enseignement est beaucoup plus récent : la première chaire, en
    France, fut créée à la Sorbonne en 1899. Cet ouvrage montre comment on est
    passé du cours public d'archéologie, à la Bibliothèque nationale à la fin du
    XVIIIe siècle, au cours d'histoire de l'art, dans les facultés des lettres
    des universités de province au début du XXe siècle, en passant par l'Ecole
    des chartes, l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts, le Collège de France et l'Ecole du
    Louvre... Genèse d'une discipline et d'une recherche, c'est aussi
    l'évolution des mentalités universitaires que nous suivons ici. Du cabinet à
    l'université, de l'érudition archéologique au diplôme universitaire, cette
    enquête historique montre les enjeux et les conflits qui marquent les débuts
    de cet enseignement spécifique.

  abstract: >-
    "À une époque où l'esthétique française affine son statut de discipline
    scientifique, les architectes convoquent à leur tour un ensemble aux
    frontières mouvantes, articulant physiologie sensorielle, psychologie ou
    sociologie, et perméable à des courants plus ésotériques. Jusqu'où ces
    savoirs guident-ils le projet d'une rationalisation des états affectifs
    engendrés par l'environnement bâti ? Comment s'ajustent-ils aux débats
    doctrinaux qui traversent le champ architectural? De César Daly à André
    Lurçat, cet ouvrage propose d'explorer ces tentatives visant à fonder une
    science de l'esthétique architecturale. De l'éclectisme stylistique au
    purisme géométrique, l'hypothèse d'un vocabulaire émotif de l'architecture
    se décline à partir de modélisations variées des processus de perception,
    d'associationnisme, des théories de l'empathie ou des conceptions
    mécanistes. Se construisent autant de méthodes d'analyse formelle, qui
    tendent à réduire l'architecture à des composantes géométriques. L'ouvrage
    révèle des continuités inattendues, entre culture beaux-arts et mouvement
    moderne; il met également en évidence les porosités des théories
    architecturales aux imaginaires scientifiques de leur temps."--P. [4] of

    A finales del siglo XX se produjo un cambio en la manera de escribir la
    historia de la arquitectura. A partir de 1999, aparece un cierto impulso
    para entender la arquitectura desde un punto de vista global, a la luz de la
    teoría postcolonial. Sibel Bozdoğan hace la siguiente proposición: escribir
    una ‘historia entrelazada/entretejida,’ que demuestre que el canon
    occidental y la producción cultural de las sociedades aparte de Europe y los
    Estados Unidos no son independientes, ni que ésta última fuera a sustituir a
    aquella. La bibliografía resultante no ha sabido mostrar las sutiles
    instancias de intercambios entre culturas y de valores universales
    compartidos, olvidándose de revisar el concepto de universalismo. Este
    trabajo de investigación propone una revisión crítica de las historias
    globales de la arquitectura publicadas entre 1999 y 2014, así como de los
    debates académicos más recientes para entender qué queda por hacer hoy.
    Aunque puede ser que ‘global,’ como categoría haya perdido su capacidad
    crítica para comprender el presente, la historiografía de lo global en
    arquitectura aún tiene que escribirse.AbstractThe writing of architectural
    history shifted with the turn of the century. By 1999, there is an urge to
    understand architecture from a global perspective, under the lens of
    postcolonial theories. Sibel Bozdoğan set the task: to write an ‘intertwined
    history,’ which shows that the western canon and the cultural production of
    societies outside of Europe and North America are not separate and
    independent, nor is the latter to replace the former. Subsequent literature
    failed to look into subtle instances of cross-cultural exchanges and
    universally shared values, thus neglecting to revise the notion of
    universalism. This paper analyses the resulting literature on global
    architecture published between 1999 and 2014, and more recent scholarly
    discussions to understand what remains for historians to do today. Though it
    may be that ‘global’ has lost its criticality as category to comprehend the
    present, the historiography of global architecture is yet to be written.

    The issues surrounding the function and meaning of vernacular architecture
    in the twenty-first century are complex and extensive. Taking a
    distinctively rigorous theoretical approach, this book considers these
    issues from a number of perspectives, broadening current debate to a wider
    multidisciplinary audience. These collected essays from the leading experts
    in the field focus on theory, education and practice in this essential
    sector of architecture, and help to formulate solutions to the
    environmental, disaster management and housing challenges facing the global
    community today.

    “History, Theory, and Criticism,” the title of many courses and even
    departments in academic schools of architecture, attests to the easy way in
    which these subjects are, however undefined, seen as basic elements of an
    architectural education. The presumed general humanistic aim of these, often
    separate courses would no doubt be the introduction of potential architects
    to history, to ways of thinking inherent to the past and present of their
    practice, and the interpretation of that practice in the past and present.
    Such courses have been in existence since the initial division of the
    subject “architecture” in professional schools—from Jacques-François
    Blondel’s categorization of the field in the 1750s to the AIA and RIBA
    protocols of the present. And while theoretical incursions from outside have
    always had their place in authorizing architectural thought, those of the
    1960s and 1970s were especially—and deliberately—unsettling. While now
    happily incorporated in “theory” courses, the resonance and implications of
    these theories for contemporary research have yet to be fully assessed.
    Their historicization is not only inevitable, but also necessary, as they
    are incorporated in the “toolkit” that Manfredo Tafuri saw as required for
    critical historical work.

    [EN] Quanzhou in south-eastern China was built in the Sui Dynasty, having
    more than 1,000 years of history. Its urban development led to the triple
    walls in a different period of time. Its unique landscape of multiple walls
    is a one of the Chinese ancient city patterns. However, the massive
    stone-built city wall pattern like Newcastle also has more than 1000, years
    of history in western cities .City walls maintain the preeminence as the
    city’s most powerful fixation line. The expansion of the wall in Quanzhou
    shows how the time-space changes, while Newcastle' s fringe belt is
    relatively stable, which forms a different urban form. This article mainly
    compares the following aspects: (1) The development of Quanzhou fringe belt;
    (2) Differences of fringe belts between the multiple walls city and the sole
    wall city; (3) Differences of land use in intramural zone between two
    cities. This paper analyzes the differences of fringe belts caused by city
    walls between Quanzhou, (China) and Newcastle, (England), and their
    influence on the urban form between the East and the West.

  abstract: >-
    Despite growing interest from historians in the built environment, the use
    of architecture as evidence remains remarkably under-theorized. Where this
    issue has been discussed, the interpretation of buildings has often been
    likened to the process of reading, in which architecture can be understood
    by analogy to language: either as a code capable of use in communicating the
    architect's intentions or more literally as a spoken or written language in
    its own right. After a historiographical survey, this essay, by contrast,
    proposes that the appropriate metaphor is one of translation. More
    particularly, it draws on the work of Mikhail Bakhtin to suggest that
    architecture-and the interpretation of architecture-comprises a series of
    transpositions. As a building is planned, built, inhabited, and interpreted,
    so its meaning changes. The underlying logic of each medium shapes the way
    in which its message is created and understood. This suggests that the
    proper role of the historian is to trace these transpositions. Buildings,
    then, can be used as a historical source, but only if the historian takes
    account of the particular problems that they present. In short, architecture
    should not be studied for its meaning, but for its meanings. As historians
    we are always translating architecture: not reading its message, but
    exploring its multiple transpositions.
