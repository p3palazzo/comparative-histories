Since the mid-nineteenth century, there have been two dominant modes of
presenting, discussing, and classifying the
architecture of the past: "comparative histories" and "critical
history". Many textbooks from the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries adopted a
*comparative method*, made famous by Banister Fletcher's eponymous book.
Since the postwar period, however, criticism
became so central to our understanding of the "duty" of history
that we would hardly admit comparative studies as a
form *history* at all. This notwithstanding, the comparative
form has a stronger claim to being *architecture*.

The critical understanding of history is ultimately best suited to
analyzing building cultures that are themselves self-consciously
historicist, hence the drift of current architectural historiography
towards an ever greater emphasis on modernism.
This brings up a long-standing
paradox regarding the place of architectural history in professional
education and practice. Comparative histories of architecture
portrayed architectural history as a
sequence of characteristic styles determined by the
constraints of the natural and social context.

The critical historians' refutation of Idealism
since the twentieth century disputed both the evolutionism and the
disciplinary bounds of comparative history.
A major achievement of critical theorists was to dispel the belief in a
universal standard for assessing different cultures. At the same time,
architectural history must integrate the irreducible diversity of
cultures into "global" surveys for consumption in the humanistic
educational model of architecture schools in the Americas.

By confronting critical histories of architecture with
the unapologetically disciplinary approach of comparative histories, we
can begin to unpack the ways in which different forms of writing have
been legitimized in different contexts as "proper" history or as
"properly architectural" history. For
better or for worse, these questions show how much of the legacy of
comparative history still bears upon the paradoxes of critical history.

Much of the disciplinary knowledge about buildings of the past does not,
indeed, make the cut of critical history. This knowledge, however,
continues to provide source material for writing histories of
architecture that pride themselves on a critical perspective. The
contradiction between both domains may well be inescapable.
Even so, architectural history has yet to come to terms with the
legitimacy of disciplinary knowledge of the architectural past. Failure
to do so has led not only to an uneasy coexistence between history and
its supporting fields, but even to the continued creeping of Idealist
assumptions into historical narratives.
